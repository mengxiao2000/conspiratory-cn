San Francisco officials recently announced that all city employees will have to be vaccinated or face possible termination. There are about 35,000 city employees. Religious exemptions or medical reasons may let some bypass the mandate, but those who refuse the shot and have no exemption will encounter consequences that could result in termination, reported the San Francisco Chronicle . The San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs’ Association published a statement on Facebook, saying they always supported safety measures against the virus but the issue at hand is that about 160 of their Sheriffs don’t want to take the vaccine due to their beliefs. The Sheriff’s Association notes that 160 of their 700 deputies are unwilling to take the vaccine, and that they can’t afford to lose them since they already have the lowest-ever staffing due to applicant testing restrictions imposed by the mayor. The Epoch Times reached out to the San Francisco mayor for comment. San Francisco and six other counties in the Bay area have reinstated a mask mandate for all indoor public activities due to the appearance of the Delta variant. The mask mandate is to be obeyed by everyone, including vaccinated people, reported the Associated Press . “It is unfortunate we have to do this at this point in the pandemic. None of us wanted to be here,” Dr. George Han, deputy health officer for Santa Clara County said, “but the virus has changed.”",1,124

On Oct. 15 following a lengthy emergency hearing on a request for injunctive relief that was filed by the city early in the day, Horan proclaimed that Catanzara must immediately stop trying to help police officers avoid the deadly clot shot, which stands a good chance of killing them. Last week, Catanzara urged Chicago police officers to not comply with the city’s mandate requiring them to tell the government whether or not they got injected with one of . “I’ve made my status very clear as far as the vaccine, but I do not believe the city has the authority to mandate that to anybody – let alone that information about your medical history,” Catanzara said in a video posted to the union’s YouTube page. Chicago Mayor Lori “Beetlejuice” Lightfoot pitched a fit after catching wind of Catanzara’s freedom of speech. She railed against the guy in a statement, falsely accusing him of “trying to foment an illegal work stoppage, a strike” by trying to protect Chicago police officers. It was Lightfoot who filed the lawsuit that led to Horan’s order, prompting the union to respond by filing a motion to dismiss. The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police also filed a separate lawsuit against the city seeking arbitration. The announcement by Horan came on the same day that all city workers in Chicago, including police officers, were told was the deadline for producing evidence that they received the jabs in obedience to the government’s command. City workers in Chicago who choose to remain unvaccinated are to be punished with mandatory twice-weekly “testing” with fraudulent PCR tests, which are calibrated to produce false “positive” test results in the unvaccinated. These tests will need to be paid for out-of-pocket by city workers, Lightfoot decreed, though Catanzara and others will apparently not be complying with the unconstitutional order. According to reports, any Chicago city worker who refuses to share his or her vaccination status with the government faces suspension. Come Dec. 31, all employees will need to be fully vaccinated in order to keep their jobs, the only exemptions being for religious or medical reasons. The restraining order on Catanzara will remain in place until Oct. 25 when there is another hearing scheduled. Immediately following the judge’s order, Catanzara uploaded a video stating: “With that being said, everybody has to do what’s in their hearts and minds, whatever that is.” Catanzara was seen in the same video holding up a sign suggesting that he is planning to run for mayor of Chicago in 2023. “Excuse me, but he is fully entitled to express his personal opinion anywhere, at any time, in any subject, to anyone,” wrote one commenter about Catanzara’s right to free speech, no matter what Horan says. “See the First Amendment. Literally the first day of judge school. Otherwise now known as Pre-K.” Another commented that the judicial branch does not have jurisdictional authority to order the executive branch to do , except in a pending case.

These liability protections were given under a declaration issued by the HHS Secretary effective Feb. 4, 2020. 8 The HHS Secretary’s declaration provides that the liability protections are in effect for “Covered Persons” for recommended activities involving “Covered Countermeasures” related to activities authorized in accordance with the public health and medical response of the Authority Having Jurisdiction, including administering “Covered Countermeasures” following a Declaration of Emergency. 9 Experimental COVID-19 vaccines that are administered under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or are officially licensed by the FDA are categorized as “Covered Countermeasures”. 10 “Covered Persons” include, among others, licensed health professionals authorized under state law to administer “Covered Countermeasures,” and individuals who are not currently authorized under state law to administer “Covered Countermeasures,” but who are expressly identified by HHS in a PREP Act declaration, and authorized in accordance with the public health and medical emergency response. 11 American Dental Association Says Dentists Have Knowledge and Skills to Administer Vaccines Currently, twenty-eight states have already given dentists the green light to administer experimental COVID-19 vaccines being distributed under an EUA during the declared COVID pandemic public health emergency. The federal declaration allows licensed dentists throughout the country to vaccinate the public against COVID-19, regardless of state laws that prohibit dentists from giving other vaccines. 12 American Dental Association President Daniel J. Klemmedson, DDS, MD and Executive Director Kathleen T. O’Loughlin said: Dentists already have the requisite knowledge and skills to administer vaccines and observe side effects—and many do so on a daily basis. Dentists are well educated in human anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, and are trained to administer intra-oral local anesthesia. It is arguably more difficult to administer an inferior alveolar nerve block inside the oral cavity than to vaccinate an exposed arm and manage any side effects. 13 Dentists Believe Their Relationships With Patients Will Assist in Tackling Vaccine Hesitancy Dentists believe that their personal relationships with their patients will be a key factor in convincing patients to get the experimental COVID-19 vaccines. Some dentists say that patients see them more often than their primary care physician, which would mean they can vaccinate more people. 14 Jessica Gruber, DDS, a dentist who works in Germantown, Wisconsin, says her 100-year-old family practice’s reputation among its longstanding patients could help tackle vaccine hesitancy. She says: A lot of people see a dentist and stick with them for years and years and years. Having health care providers that have that strong foundation with their patients could be beneficial toward convincing people that this is something that is good. 15 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here .

However, he intends it as a wakeup call because he feels too many Americans are sleeping through the attacks on our health and our nation now. Adams warns not to get the COVID “vaccines” which he describes as bioweapons. As shown further below, China is not using the dangerous mRNA COVID shots! Adams explains that many American politicians and corporations have sold out to China for the money. He explains that China has conquered the US but is willing to remain behind the scenes for now. It owns Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Media, most senators and governors, Joe Biden and his son, corporations like Nike, the NBA, etc. He says that China controlled the 2020 election in various ways. He says that China has been waging a stealth war on the US for about 40 years. Until Clinton betrayed his supporters and signed NAFTA which created the World Trade Organization and globalization, everything in the US said “Made in America”. Now, almost everything says “Made in China”. Adams warns that a very bloody false flag attack is coming to try to convince or force Americans to give up their guns. However, he warns not to give up your guns because the Second Amendment is our best protection against an overt Chinese takeover now. COVID Bioweapon: Economic Attack on America Adams says the release of the coronavirus bioweapon was just one step in China’s attack on the US. China used COVID-19 to destroy our economy with the collusion of people like Gates and Fauci. Adams compares the implosion of America now to the implosion of the condo in Miami in June. Adams explains that one woman was able to get out in time because she heard strange noises at 2AM and saw cracks in the wall. When she could no longer close the door, she knew the building had shifted and got out immediately. Others slept through the collapse. Nearly 55 of the 136 units of the Champlain Towers South in Surfside just north of Miami Beach pancaked to the ground in the early hours of June 24. The number of confirmed deaths remains at 24, and 121 people are unaccounted for. Report says building was demolished . Controlled Demolition of the American Empire is a 2020 book which shows the parallels between the takedown of America now and the demolition of WTC Building 7 on 9/11. China’s Three-Step Takeover of US Mike Adams says the goal of Americans collaborating with China (including the Biden administration, members of the Senate and Congress, media, Big Tech, science establishment, banks, Hollywood, professional sports, and universities) is to turn the US over to Communist China. Step 1: Use COVID To Destroy US Economy and COVID “Vaccines” To Mass Murder Americans Adams says China ordered the US to achieve a 70% “vaccination” rate among adults because this extermination weapon will kill tens of millions of Americans. Adams says this is why Biden wanted to achieve a 70% “vaccination” rate by July 4 . Adams believes it is no coincidence that COVID “vaccines” are causing blood clots which are killing young, able-bodied men because they are the people who would be called up in a national draft to defend America. HEART INFLAMMATION IN YOUTH RECENTLY VAXXED says: “Serious cases of myocarditis in young people after receiving the #Covid19 vaccines are piling up across the US.” Might COVID Injections Reduce Lifespan? MRNA Inventor Says To Stop COVID “Vaccines” Now reports: “ Dr. Robert Malone , inventor of the mRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID shots, was interviewed on June 24 by Del Bigtree, host of The Highwire . Dr. Malone is calling for an immediate halt to the COVID ‘vaccines’.” mRNA VACCINE INVENTOR CALLS FOR STOP OF COVID VAX says, “Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of the mRNA vaccine, sits down with Del to give his honest concerns about why this is the wrong technology to use against #Covid19 and, in particular, the extreme danger it poses to young people.” Covid: What do we know about China’s coronavirus vaccines? says China is not using an mRNA vaccine. Step 2: False Flag Attack To Disarm America Adams says China wants America’s farmland to feed its people. China has had a food supply collapse and China will collapse unless it can import food . So, China’s next step will be a land invasion of the US. However, America’s guns must first be confiscated because armed Americans would defend the nation with guerrilla warfare. Adams warns there will almost certainly be a major false flag in the next few months against an ethnic minority (Asians, Blacks, or Hispanics) causing hundreds of deaths blamed on White gun owners, Trump supporters, veterans, etc. The national emotional outcry from this attack will be used to convince Republican senators to support a gun control bill. Biden’s New “Red Flag” Law Encourages States to Take Guns Without Due Process warns: “Red flag laws have been passed in a total of 19 states and police are showing how willing they are to use them. With Biden’s plan, these laws will be extended to all 50 states. Citizens who are targeted by these laws are deemed guilty first and only after their guns are taken, will they have a chance to defend themselves in court. This is de facto removal of due process.” Govt to Force Gun Owners to Pay Annual Tax, Will Confiscate Guns from Those Who Refuse : “In a move that is being celebrated by the anti-gun crowd , the government of San Jose, California has passed a resolution — unanimously — to force gun owners to pay an annual tax and carry insurance for the privilege of self-defense. Though the forthcoming tax amount has yet to be determined, lawmakers have already determined that they will begin confiscating guns from anyone who refuses to pay it. This move comes on the heels of another Orwellian gun law the city passed two weeks ago which requires every single gun purchase to be video and audio recorded and that media stored indefinitely.” The map below shows gun ownership by state. China used Big Tech to destroy the First Amendment and is now going after the Second Amendment. While Big Tech says it is following the World Health Organization’s guidelines on COVID-19, they are really taking orders from China. That explains why Big Tech does not change its policies to follow WHO policy changes. Step 3: Land Invasion By China Across US Southern Border Adams says if the majority of American AR-15 gun owners can be convinced after this bloody false flag attack to give up their guns, China will launch its land attack very quickly from the southern border. Adams reports multiple sources confirmed that both China and Russia have been working with Mexican drug cartels to move equipment across the southern border and stage it in the US. That includes mortars, RPGs, full auto AK-47s, suppressors, etc. Now, it’s clear why Trump wanted to “build the wall” and Congress refused to fund it. Adams explains that Chinese troops would move in from the south and conquer cities and towns. They would execute mayors and governors and murder everyone to lay claim to the land state by state. The only thing stopping that now is America’s widespread gun ownership. However, Adams says COVID has awakened many Americans. So, he predicts that many people will see through the false flag and few Americans will give up their guns. As an indication of that awakening, Adams says while many Democrats have taken the COVID injection, few gun owners have. Note: Many Marines, Police, NFL, Nurses Refuse COVID Shot Second Amendment Sanctuaries Surge Across US Adams explains that 61% of US counties have achieved Second Amendment Sanctuary status. He says the movement is surging. About 20 states have declared sanctuary and that effort is also accelerating rapidly. 61% of U.S. counties now ‘Second Amendment sanctuaries’ reports: “As of June 20, there are 1,930 counties ‘protected by Second Amendment Sanctuary legislation at either the state or county level,’ representing 61% of 3,141 counties and county equivalents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Texas was the 21st state to pass a constitutional carry bill, which Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law, and becomes effective Sept. 1. And while some state legislatures are not taking the same action, county officials have chosen to enact their own legislation. Roughly 1,137 counties ‘have taken it upon themselves to pass Second Amendment Sanctuary legislation and likely hundreds of cities, townships, boroughs, etc. have done so at their level as well,’ the site states. The Second Amendment sanctuary movement was born out of a grassroots effort, brought on by county or municipal leaders who vowed to not enforce any gun laws imposed by state or federal bodies they deemed were unconstitutional. Sheriffs have also made pledges to uphold the Second Amendment, most recently every sheriff in Utah. Upon signing the new Texas law, Abbott said Texas was a Second Amendment Sanctuary state. Months earlier, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts signed a proclamation giving Nebraska the same sanctuary designation. And Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill that nullifies federal gun laws in the Show Me state. The movement is growing in light of statements made by President Joe Biden that the federal government will target firearms dealers in an attempt to link the increasing number of homicides occurring in major cities to a lack of gun law enforcement. ‘We’ll find you and we will seek your license to sell guns,’ Biden said last week.” Why Is Canada Training Chinese Troops? Adams doesn’t mention that China could invade the US from Canada. He also doesn’t address reports that Canada has been training Chinese troops and that China reportedly tried to invade the US in December. Ezra Levant of Canada’s Rebel Media is the author of China Virus: How Justin Trudeau’s Pro Communist Ideology Is Putting Canadians In Danger . Trudeau invited Chinese troops to train at Canadian military bases says “Rebel Media’s Ezra Levant wrote: ‘Justin Trudeau invited China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to send its troops for cold weather training at CFB Petawawa in Ontario — and Trudeau raged at the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) for cancelling the training after China kidnapped Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig. ‘This is only one of many bombshell revelations in The China Files, a 34-page access to information document released by the Trudeau government to Rebel News.’ “The China Files show that Trudeau’s submissive approach to China isn’t just his personal obsession — it’s the official policy of his entire government and it has deeply infected Canada’s civil service, too. Trudeau’s right-hand man, Ian Shugart, was tasked with silencing the CAF’s legitimate concerns about China, and forcing our military to continue acting as if China, not the U.S., was our most important ally. “As a public service, Rebel News is publishing the documents in full in the hopes that other reporters will continue to unlock the truth about how Trudeau is turning Canada away from our democratic allies, and towards the world’s greatest dictatorship.” Levant has made the files available at The China Files . Did Chinese Troops Invade US From Canada In December? C16 FIGHTER JET SHOT DOWN BY CHINESE TROOPS IN CANADA THE US BOMBS CHINESE DUMB NEAR MAINE includes an audio report which says starting at 14:56 that an F-16 fighter jet was shot down in Madison, Wisconsin. It says locals were reporting a Chinese military incursion from Canada and the jet was scrambled to intercept the Chinese troops. The plane was shot down and the pilot is still missing, believed to have been captured by the Chinese military which fled back to Canada. It says the next day, a bomb detonated a DUMB (Deep Underground Military Base) in Maine where 50,000 Chinese troops had assembled after coming from Canada by boat. The following articles say it’s a conspiracy theory that the US bombed 50,000 Chinese troops as they tried to invade Maine in December 2020 and the Chinese retaliated by shooting down an F-16 over Michigan and capturing the pilot. They say it was an earthquake in Maine and the pilot crashed and died. They maintain that the howitzers in Maine in December (shown in the photo below) had nothing to do with defending against an attack and were just being moved. No, the US didn’t bomb 50,000 Chinese troops as they tried to invade Maine No, Chinese troops are not on the Canadian border — and the dangers of misinformation : FACT CHECK!

Earlier this week, they released a strong earnings report that exceeded the already optimistic projections from Wall Street. They also announced that they are on the verge of gaining regulatory approval to give their vaccine to minors aged 12 to 15 in the U.S. This coincides with the Biden Administration’s increasing pressure on states to raise their vaccination numbers. Media reports have also indicated that Pfizer is looking to gain approval to use the vaccine on in the U.S. and Europe. It is believed that this approval could come in September, despite the fact that there have been no studies carried out into the long-term effects of the vaccines on either adults or children. Pfizer CEO Albert Borland stated in a call with reporters and analysts that the pharmaceutical firm is in discussions with what he termed “basically all the governments of the world” to provide COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots through the year 2024. Indeed, they have already laid the groundwork for a steady stream of revenue by telling the public that they will likely need at least one additional shot a year after their second dose. He also mentioned that people around the world may end up needing yearly shots, much like the flu shot, which would help Pfizer to grow its bottom line and shift COVID-19 vaccines from an emergency measure to a permanent and highly profitable line of business. Pfizer has said that they expect sales of their vaccines to reach $26 million by year’s end. This would make the shot their top-selling pharmaceutical product, an honor that currently goes to the rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira. In addition, they are planning to use the mRNA technology behind the COVID-19 vaccine for other types of vaccines and therapies. They are already trying to develop seasonal flu shots based on the RNA lipid nanoparticle technology. In addition, they are exploring making COVID-19 vaccines more durable by finding ways that doses can be stored at the temperatures seen in a standard refrigerator, which is something that could raise demand for the jabs in poorer countries. Either way, however, Bourla is expecting the vaccines to have a “durable demand”. The virus is working out incredibly well for Pfizer, whose earnings were so strong that they also helped lift the shares of other vaccine makers around the world. For example, shares of Asian vaccine makers who had deals to distribute the Pfizer vaccines rallied this week. India’s Pfizer Ltd unit climbed 4.9 percent on Wednesday, while Cadila Healthcare and Dr. Reddy’s rose 5.9 and 2.7 percent respectively. Once again, we see pharmaceutical companies raking in money at the expense of the public. Now that many of the people who were inclined to get the vaccine have already done so, they are going to start pressuring parents into having their kids vaccinated, despite the fact that children are not being hit by the virus nearly as hard as adults. They are also doing this in the absence of studies demonstrating its safety in any age group. The truth is that no one knows yet how this vaccine can affect anyone over the long term, particularly children whose bodies are still developing. But that’s not really a big concern for Pfizer or any of the other makers as they have all been should their vaccines cause people harm or kill them – which they are already doing in droves.",1,-1

PDF Des shills technocrates mondiaux qui ont pompé l'hystérie du taux de mortalité dans les médias, ainsi que des politiques dystopiques, ont été exposés en Italie. Dans le monde, il est désormais probable que plus de 90 % des décès étaient « avec COVID » et non « à cause de COVID ». Cela pourrait entrer dans l'histoire comme la plus grande escroquerie que le monde ait jamais vue, et avec les conséquences les plus mortelles. Éditeur TN L'Institut supérieur italien de la santé a considérablement réduit le nombre officiel de décès dus au COVID dans le pays de plus de 97% après avoir changé la définition d'un décès en une personne décédée du COVID plutôt que du COVID. Journal italien Le temps rapporte que l'Institut a révisé à la baisse le nombre de personnes décédées du COVID plutôt que du COVID de 130,000 4,000 à moins de XNUMX XNUMX. ""Oui, tu l'as bien lu. Il s'avère que 97.1% des décès jusqu'à présent attribués à Covid n'étaient pas dus directement à Covid », écrit Toby Jeune. Sur les 130,468 3,783 décès enregistrés comme décès officiels dus au COVID depuis le début de la pandémie, seuls XNUMX XNUMX sont directement attribuables au seul virus. « Tous les autres Italiens qui ont perdu la vie avaient entre une et cinq maladies préexistantes. Parmi les personnes de plus de 67 ans décédées, 7 % avaient plus de trois comorbidités et 18 % au moins deux », écrit Young. «Selon l'Institut, 65.8% des Italiens décédés après avoir été infectés par Covid étaient atteints d'hypertension artérielle (hypertension), 23.5% souffraient de démence, 29.3% de diabète et 24.8% de fibrillation auriculaire. Ajoutez à cela, 17.4% avaient des problèmes pulmonaires, 16.3% avaient eu un cancer au cours des cinq dernières années et 15.7% avaient déjà souffert d'insuffisance cardiaque. La nouvelle définition de l'Institut d'un décès par COVID signifie que COVID a tué moins de personnes en Italie que (chuchote-le) la grippe saisonnière moyenne. Si un changement similaire était apporté par d'autres gouvernements nationaux, le nombre officiel de décès dus au COVID serait réduit d'une marge de plus de 90 %. Ne vous attendez pas à ce que beaucoup d'autres emboîtent le pas, étant donné que les gouvernements ont investi une grande partie de leur autorité dans la promotion de la menace posée par le virus. Par exemple, les psychologues comportementaux au Royaume-Uni travaillé avec l'état délibérément « exagérer » la menace de COVID via des méthodes de propagande « non éthiques » et « totalitaires » afin de terrifier le public dans le respect de masse. Et cela a fonctionné. A enquête menée après le premier verrouillage a révélé que le Britannique moyen pensait que 100 fois plus de personnes étaient mortes de COVID que le nombre officiel de morts. Maintenant, nous comprenons que le chiffre officiel tué « par COVID » et non « avec COVID » est inférieur à un dixième de ce qui est officiellement rapporté comme le nombre total de morts par COVID. Malgré le changement, l'Italie peut encore prendre la décision rendre le vaccin COVID-19 obligatoire, bien que la manière dont un tel régime serait imposé reste indéterminée.

In Europe and Australia, protests and rallies against vaccine mandates and other Covid-19 restrictions have been met with an increasingly brutal police response, with many activists and participants getting arrested, fined, and otherwise persecuted by law enforcement authorities for their activism. France and Germany had massive protests in major cities across the country during the last weekend in August, a continuation of rallies and protests that have been taking place for weeks now. In Germany, police attempted to ban a number of pre-planned demonstrations, a clear violation of freedom of assembly, free speech, and political protest rights, once the hallmark of Western civilization. Mass police mobilization was witnessed in major urban centers across Germany, as videos emerged on social media of heavy-handed and often violent police responses to protesters. Protests also continued across France, whose parliament has attempted to implement a vaccine passport law requiring businesses to check the vaccine status of patrons of restaurants, gyms, theaters and other public venues. Similar vaccine passport policies are currently being implemented by municipal governments in the United States, including New York City and San Francisco, while other metro areas and counties consider such measures. The French have been particularly defiant, as countless citizens proudly boycott restaurants, bars, and other businesses attempting to comply with the central government’s overreaching vaccine passport policy. As one form of protest, French citizens have gathered in front of restaurants, cafes, bars, and other businesses that are enforcing the vaccine passport policy. They are bringing snacks, drinks, and meals and sitting in large groups outside the establishment to picnic with friends and family. French media and the country’s interior minister estimate that 160,000 people protested across the nation on Saturday, Aug. 28 in 222 separate protest actions. An estimated 14,500 protested in Paris alone. Many view the vaccine passport and lockdowns as entirely unnecessary, tyrannical, and a basic violation of human rights. “The vaccine isn’t the solution,” Helene Vierondeels, a retiree who attended a protest in Paris, told popular news outlet France24. Others were upset with proposed vaccine mandates for school children and teachers. “We aren’t laboratory rats,” said one 11-year-old child in Bordeaux, referring to the Covid-19 vaccines that until recently have only been authorized under an emergency use authorization. Serious injuries, side effects, and even deaths have been reported from the vaccines, but, given the hundreds of millions of doses that have already been administered across the globe, they do remain rare. “We live in a free country, there are no figures that justify mass vaccinations,” the young boy’s father also noted. In the United Kingdom, protests also continued, including one right outside a newly developed Covid vaccination center in Churchill Square, a large shopping mall in Brighton, England. Due to the protest, the vaccine center was forced to shut down, at least temporarily. “Our site will remain closed until at least 4:30 p.m. due to disruption,” the Sussex Community NHS stated. “Please do not attend appointments or walk-ins. We’re contacting people with booked appointments to rearrange.” Australia, which has implemented arguably the most tyrannical and Orwellian Covid restrictions, has also witnessed a number of major protests, including an organized demonstration by truck drivers, recently. Australian police and political officials have enacted harsh measures against any form of protest or resistance to the lockdown agenda, including investigating and arresting individuals merely organizing public events online through social media sites. Anthony Khallouf, a 29-year-old activist and a self-described guerrilla journalist, recently had an appeal dismissed in Australia and has been ordered to serve a minimum three-month jail sentence for “breaches of public health orders,” according to Australian media. Khallouf has been a vocal and active organizer of protests and rallies in defiance of lockdowns and other draconian public health orders, and has been persecuted largely for encouraging others to protest and resist the governmental bullying being implemented in the name of Covid-19. The pro-vaccine, pro-lockdown, pro-mask, pro-police state agenda shows no signs of abating, as virtually every major and minor political figure and media outlet parrot the same exact talking points, encouraging mass vaccination. Those who question the narrative or simply refuse to be vaccinated continue to be punished and shunned, regardless of their reasoning or circumstances. A judge in a recent child custody case in Chicago ordered that an unvaccinated mother could not see her child until she was vaccinated, demonstrating how out of control the vaccine pushers have become. “Judges in America are now revoking custody of children if parents aren’t vaxxed,” James Edwards, a popular talk radio host, Tweeted recently in response to the judge’s absurd order. “Thank God we live in a free country, though,” Edwards concluded sarcastically. Across the Western world, globalist governments continue to implement increasingly tyrannical policies designed to curtail medical freedom, free speech and assembly, and other basic human rights that once formed the bedrock of Western civilization. Protests are likely to continue, despite the heavy-handed police approach in most Western nations, particularly Australia. Speaking out publicly and peaceful resistance are several of the only effective measures against the full-on assault governments are waging in the name of combatting Covid-19.",1,-1

William Shipp, principal of Woodgrove High School, spoke at about 3:45 p.m. local time on Jan. 28 to unmasked students assembled in the school’s auxiliary gym. “You have all chosen not to wear a mask this week. Essentially, that is just defiant of the rules Loudoun County Public Schools have put up,” Shipp said in a video reviewed by The Epoch Times. He told the students that they would face immediate suspension starting from the next school day on Feb. 2 if they walked into the school without wearing a mask; the suspension wouldn’t end until the students started wearing masks, he added. In response to a student’s question whether the suspension was legal, Shipp referred to Loudoun County school board policy and affirmed, “At this point, there is suspension.” He also said there was an appeal process to follow. During the suspension, students can still use Schoology, the virtual learning platform, to continue their studies, according to Shipp. Caroline and Laura Thomas’s letters from Woodgrove High School were identical except for student ID and other personal information. Any students “who willfully continue to refuse to follow COVID mitigation measures as required by Loudoun County Public Schools will be suspended from school” for “disobedience” and “defiance,” according to the letters. Clint Thomas, the students’ father, questioned the “double standard.” While the school district cited the Virginia Department of Health’s (VDH) interim Guidance for COVID-19 Prevention in Pre-K–12 Schools under Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam , it has declined to follow VDH’s updated guidance under Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who was inaugurated on Jan. 15. VDH’s updated guidance for Pre-K–12 schools states the roles and responsibilities among parents, schools, and public health institutions. The decision of masking and vaccinating lies with parents. Clint Thomas told The Epoch Times that the reason for the suspension was “not masking” but “defiance.” “[Principal Shipp] is pushing them to wear a mask so he doesn’t have to suspend them,” he said. LCPS is one of the districts in the state that have decided to keep the mask mandate, despite Youngkin’s executive order that gave the masking decision to parents. Virginia has more than 130 school districts, with about 50 following the same course as Loudoun County. ‘Every Day Felt Like a Prison’ Madison Dunbar, a sophomore at Woodgrove who also was unmasked in school last week, told The Epoch Times that it’s ridiculous for LCPS to force students to choose between masking and in-person learning. Her younger siblings Hailey and Zack attend Harmony Middle School. The letter from Harmony states: “A student who is suspended because of non-compliance with COVID-mitigation measures may return to school only when they agree to follow COVID-mitigation measures throughout the entire school day and at all indoor school-related events. Suspension will continue if COVID-mitigation measures are not followed.” Kayla, an 11th-grader at Woodgrove, also didn’t wear a mask to school. During the week, she repeatedly asked teachers and administrators, “Where is my in-person learning?” She said the educators simply referred to Schoology, LCPS’s virtual learning platform. Kayla, as well as Caroline and Laura Thomas, said that starting on Jan. 25, unmasked students had to use a back door to exit the school several minutes earlier than masked students. In addition, the unmasked students were made to enter the school through the main entrance and walk past masked students in the morning to go to their separate location. She said that she felt that the unmasked students were being shamed. For example, the auxiliary gym they were sent to from Jan. 25 to Jan. 28 had an uncovered window. “The masked kids would just sit there and take pictures of us, and laugh at us, every day,” she told The Epoch Times. Caroline Thomas, who has compiled a daily journal of her experience, also wrote about the separate exit. She noted that she didn’t get an answer when asked why she had to leave the school from a different exit than masked students. “I’m sure it’s because they didn’t want us to ‘infect’ the rest of the school,” she wrote. “Every day felt like a prison. Each day gets crazier and crazier.” Emma, Kayla’s younger sister and a 9th-grader at Woodgrove, told The Epoch Times: “Teachers really didn’t care about our education. They just brushed it under the rug like we didn’t need to learn.” Kayla’s mother, Joy, who prefers not to disclose the family name, said: “Kayla was having trouble sleeping. She was having trouble eating. The entire week, [they were] more stressed out than I have ever seen either of my girls. “They were trying to do the right thing but kind of caught in the middle. They want to follow what they’re told to do but want to hold their ground because they know their freedoms.” All of the Woodgrove girls who were interviewed noted that on Jan. 28, the number of unmasked students was more than 50, the highest number for the week. According to Erin Dunbar, Hailey, and Zack’s mother, the number of unmasked students in Harmony Middle School topped 20 on the last day of the week. LCPS spokesperson Wayde Byard said that he had no comment when contacted by The Epoch Times about the suspension plan and VDH’s updated guidance.",1,112

In comments at the White House, Biden stopped short of imposing a vaccine mandate right away. But he said he has asked the Defense Department to look into how, and when, the military will add vaccines to protect against COVID-19 to the list of other vaccinations service members must receive. Biden said making the vaccines mandatory is important because troops often serve in places where vaccination rates are low and COVID is prevalent. “Men and women in uniform, who protect this country against grave threats, should be protected as much as possible from getting COVID-19,” he said. According to the NY Times , Members of the military are regularly given vaccines, and unvaccinated service members are sometimes not allowed to deploy abroad and face other restrictions. But as a political matter, forcing vaccines on the military is all but certain to set off a firestorm among Mr. Biden’s critics. Many conservatives have suggested that Mr. Biden is making the military too “woke” and have warned that forcing vaccines on troops would be a bridge too far. The White House was already taken aback, some military officials said, by the blowback to its door-to-door vaccine information campaign and has since treaded carefully on the mandate issue, especially as it would apply to troops. Military commanders and doctors have become increasingly frustrated by their lack of tools to increase vaccine uptake among troops, as they warily eye rising infection rates. Younger troops have been most hesitant to get the shot, calculating that their symptoms would be mild if they caught virus. But the Delta variant has been hitting younger patients, and with more force. Ricky Scaparo Ricky Scaparo is the pastor and founder of the international ministry End Time Headlines .

Many people are unaware of the story , but it reads like a dress rehearsal for everything we are seeing take place today in response to the Chinese Virus. The government and media claimed that the mysterious pneumonia disease was spreading through the air: check . People getting sick and having to be hospitalized was used to authorize the use of secret police: check . The media was told to cover up the source of true source of the disease, which turned out to be a deep state laboratory: check . Nearly every component of the 1979 Yekaterinburg pneumonia outbreak matches the Fauci Flu “pandemic” of today, right down to the false narrative that it had randomly jumped species from animal to human â that is until American spies reportedly picked up cues pointing to a different narrative. Today, those “spies” are everyday sleuths with a brain, as well as a handful of broken-from-the-ranks doctors and politicians who are defying the prevailing narrative in favor of actual evidence, which suggests that the Wuhan Flu originated in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). “You’re thinking this is another coronavirus story â only it’s somehow planted 42 years in the past, right? Not this time,” reports Western Journal . “While the Soviet anthrax incident looked eerily like it could’ve been a rehearsal for communist Chinaâs apparent COVID-19 release, the two were not planned to be similar.” “But it was perhaps our first small-scale glimpse into what would take the world by storm four decades later … and it reiterates that history repeats itself.” Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies Interestingly, it was a New York Times Moscow bureau chief who recently picked up on the 1979 Yekaterinburg incident, highlighting its relevancy in light of today’s revelations concerning the Chinese Disease. While it might seem impossible for authoritarian governments to mask the truth time and time again, we now know that it has happened at least twice, as evidenced by news reports published even years after the fact that continued to accept the Soviet narrative that the 1979 pneumonia scare was a mere accident rather than a planned false flag. “Wild rumors do spread around every epidemic,” wrote Nobel Prize-winning American biologist Joshua Lederberg in a 1986 memo to the Times . “The current Soviet account is very likely to be true.” My oh my, how things do not change. All last year, the mainstream media propped up the Fauci narrative that the Wuhan Flu came from bats at a wet market, even though there was zero evidence to support that claim. Only in recent days has the media finally started to come around now that it is an undeniable fact that the Chinese Virus was no mere accident. No, the Fauci Flu was hatched by Fauci and his friends to pull a fast one on the world while ushering in the “great reset.” There are still many in denial, including Fauci himself, who have either convinced themselves to believe the lies they tell or are just so used to telling them that they could never feasibly tell the truth even if they tried. “It’s been 40 years â the Berlin Wall has fallen, the Soviet Union has collapsed, we’ve witnessed communism’s lies, corruption and collapse time and again … yet American scientists still believe them,” warns the Western Journal . “American elites stupidly let the Soviets spread a deadly lie for over a decade. Let’s make sure we don’t make the same mistake with China.” Chinese Virus deception is everywhere. To keep up with the latest, visit Pandemic.news .

The chances of a child between 5-11 requiring intensive care following a “positive” covid test is also only about one in 50,000, the same study found. In a nutshell, children have an almost zero risk of getting sick from the Chinese Virus, and yet health authorities want all of them to get injected with “vaccines” that could cause them to develop heart disease or die . The science simply does not support mass-jabbing children with mystery chemicals for an alleged virus that does not even threaten them. “The findings, in a nutshell: If you let your healthy child or teenager receive the mRNA covid vaccine, you are insane,” wrote Alex Berenson on his Substack blog. Getting back to the study, a team of German physician-scientists found that even among children with preexisting health conditions, only six died after receiving a positive test result for the Fauci Flu. “Overall, the SARS-CoV-2-associated burden of a severe disease course or death in children and adolescents is low,” the team wrote in conclusion. “This seems particularly the case for 5-11-year-old children without comorbidities.” Why would you inject a healthy child with deadly mRNA chemicals? In Great Britain, a team of researchers there came to a similar conclusion, discovering that children are naturally immune to the Chinese Flu â no need for any injections. Seeing as how the jabs pose serious health risks and have barely been tested, especially on children, why risk harming them with experimental drugs from pharmaceutical companies that are immune from all liability? Keep in mind that there is not a single injection currently on the market that has approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). All of them have what is known as “emergency use authorization” (EUA), which is invalid to begin with as there are other remedies currently available (i.e., hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin) that work against coronaviruses. The government does not want people to have these remedies, of course, but they do exist. And since they exist, there cannot legally be EUA given to experimental injections, even though the prevailing narrative suggests that the only remedy for the Chinese Flu is the “vaccines.” “Given the known risks of vaccine-induced myocarditis in young men, the fact that Pfizer tested its mRNA vaccines on barely 3,000 children 5-11 and followed most of them for only weeks after the second dose, the German data again raises the question of how health authorities can possibly justify encouraging children or teenagers to be vaccinated,” Berenson further writes on his blog. Various commenters at Great Game India , which reported on the two studies, wrote about how strange it is that the White House and other government bureaucracies are in a mad rush to get everyone jabbed at “warp speed,” almost like they have some kind of deadline. “They’re in a big hurry to get everyone injected: men, women, and children,” one wrote. “The virology deception is falling apart quickly. No time to lose!” “The news I have read says that covid does not kill kids, but the vaccines do, or they get severe heart conditions from the vaccines, which they will probably die from within the next five years,” wrote another. “The problem with heart disease is that it can strike at any time, not just after getting the vaccines, but when doing excessive physical games or sport.” Another wrote that it is almost unbelievable that any of this is real and happening right before our eyes. “That we would subject our children to this insane DNA modification for the future of humanity” is insane, this person wrote.

According to USA Today, agents raided the Rolling Meadows, Ill., firm known as the Center for COVID Control, after the company came under investigation by state and federal officials for alleged shady practices. “The FBI was conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity in Rolling Meadows yesterday,” Siobhan Johnson, a spokesperson for the FBI’s Chicago office, told the paper just days ago. When asked about the raid, Illinois Attorney General spokeswoman Annie Thompson said that the AG “is absolutely committed to protecting residents from those who attempt to profit off of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.” “We are working with the FBI and other law enforcement partners and will not comment on ongoing investigations as we work to hold accountable individuals who engage in unlawful conduct,” Thompson added. : The paper said it began investigating the company after one of its reporters encountered a “pop-up” testing site that was being operated out of a shack in Chicago powered by a generator. “The Center for COVID Control is also under investigation by the Illinois Attorney General’s Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Oregon Department of Justice is investigating the company on suspicion of Unfair Trade Practices Act violations,” the paper added. Illinois isn’t the only state investigating the company; so is Minnesota, which has filed suit against it as well. According to a press release from Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office, the AG received numerous complaints from Minnesotans who said they submitted tests at sites operated by the Center for COVID Control but never got the results from a lab associated with the company, Doctors Clinical Laboratory, even though they waited for them for weeks. Others got faulty test results, and some people reported receiving test results even though they never submitted a sample to be tested. “My job is to fight for Minnesotans’ security and help them live with dignity, safety, and respect. Making sure that Minnesotans have accurate tools to [keep] them safe from the COVID-19 pandemic is a key part of that job,” Attorney General Ellison said. “When Minnesotans and people from around the country tested with these companies to keep themselves and their families safe, they trusted they would get correct results on time. I’m holding these companies accountable that sent back false or inaccurate results, when they sent them back at all, for deceiving Minnesotans and undermining the public’s trust in testing,” he added. Fine — but what about the COVID-19 vaccine ? And will the Biden regime investigate itself ?",1,-1

Nowhere is there any focus on real medical information being propagated about these dangerous injections. ******** World Economic Forum releases guide on how to coerce and manipulate public into getting the Covid-19 Vaccine THE DAILY EXPOSE The World Economic Forum have had a bigger part to play during the past fifteen months than many of you may realise, and now they have released a helpful guide for Governments and Public Health Officials around the world on how to coerce and manipulate the general public into getting the Covid-19 vaccine. . The WEF state in a recent article that in order to achieve herd immunity to the alleged Covid-19 disease, public health officials should use “advertising theory”, manipulate the way people think and feel about getting the jab, use community leaders and health workers to voice propaganda, and offer bribes as incentives to “help get skeptics through the doors of local vaccination centres”.Advertising theory revolves around the Hierarchy of Effects Framework, which suggest that “customers think first, then feel and then do”. The WEF believe that policy makers around the world are currently only accommodating for people who are already interested in getting the Covid jab, so they recommend that in order to convince skeptics, officials should resort to three simple methods of coercion and manipulation. The first step the WEF recommend public health officials implement involves “increasing knowledge and overcoming misinformation”. This revolves around the “think” stage of the advertising theory and states that local leaders proactively reach out and educate skeptics via “media such as phone calls, direct mail, television, billboard, and digital channels”. Why do they recommend this? Because thanks to research, the WEF think that people are “likely to believe the invention and approval process of the vaccines was rushed, with under-reported side effects”. The problem with the WEF’s advice here is that people are quite right to believe the invention and approval process was rushed. They are also right to believe that there under-reported side effects. This isn’t a matter of opinion, it’s a matter of fact. The average time it has taken for all vaccines on the market to be approved is around eight years. They began administering the Covid-19 vaccines into the arms of the general public within 11 months of them allegedly being created , but even then they weren’t approved like other vaccines, they were instead given emergency use authorisation. Why were they only given emergency use authorisation? Because they are still in phase three trials and are therefore experimental. The emergency use authorisation means that the manufacturer of the vaccine cannot be held liable for any injury that may occur as a result of the vaccine. As for under reported side-effects? Well have you ever heard of the MHRA Yellow Card scheme ? Many people haven’t and this is precisely why side-effects are under reported. The Yellow Card scheme allows people to report any adverse reactions they may have had due to the Covid-19 vaccines, and the MHRA believe that just 1% – 10% of adverse reactions are actually reported. This makes the actual number of adverse reactions and deaths reported to the scheme quite frightening when you take the under reporting into account. Because according to the 21 st update released by the UK Government / MHRA on adverse reactions to the Covid-19 vaccines there have been 973,425 adverse reactions ranging from mild to extremely serious and 1,356 deaths up to the 16 th June 2021. The second step the WEF recommend public health officials implement involves propaganda and harassment. This revolves around the “feel” stage of the advertising theory and states that the vaccine hesitant should be bombarded with phone calls and discussions, and harassed on social media to persuade them to get the Covid jab. The WEF also suggest another way to improve vaccine skeptics’ feelings is to play into a fear of missing out (FOMO), both socially and economically . To achieve this the WEF recommend that public health officials use tactics that induce guilt and regret. They suggest this can be done in a similar fashion as was successfully employed in Canada during the 1930’s and 1940’s to confront diphtheria. During this period, they used messages such as “if your children die of diphtheria, it is your fault because you prefer not to take the trouble to protect against it”. The problem here is that the Covid vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission , therefore using messaging such as what the WEF recommends is coercion and would not amount to informed consent , because instead the person would be extremely misinformed. The Covid jabs have only allegedly been proven to reduce the risk of being hospitalised or dying from Covid-19, a risk that is already incredibly small for most people amounting to around 0.02% on average. The limited trials carried out only measured whether or not a vaccinated person suffered serious disease if infected with Covid-19, but they were flawed as nobody was exposed to the virus during the study, they only measured what occurred when out in the general population. They did not measure whether a vaccinated person could still become infected with Covid-19, and they did not measure whether or not a vaccinated person could still spread the virus in line with the mainstream accepted germ theory. Pretty disgraceful advice from the WEF considering the above isn’t it? The third and final step the WEF recommend public health officials implement involves bribery, and cold-calling . This revolves around the “do” stage of the advertising theory and states that incentives should be offered to coerce people to get the Covid-19 vaccine, as well as harassing people at their homes in an attempt to persuade them to have the jab there and then. The WEF advises public health officials to offer cash incentives, free transportation, paid time-off, free products, and lottery giveaways as bribes to “encourage” take up of the Covid jab. They also advise that pop-up clinics are set up in under-served areas with vaccine-hesitant populations and to create “vaccine swat teams” that harass people in their homes under the guise of reaching people who are “home-bound” or “experience difficulty” in getting to vaccination centres. The World Economic Forum state that they “ believe applying the “think – feel – do” patient-centered approach to the COVID-19 vaccine communication problem will improve efforts at accelerating global herd immunity. Ensuring a safe economic reopening and recovery and overcoming this significant health and economic challenge could depend on such tactics”. The Covid-19 vaccine will not ensure a safe economic reopening and recovery, just as Covid-19 never caused a safe closure and decimation of the economy. It was tyrannical governments and their one-dimensional scientific advisors who closed and destroyed the economy, but it couldn’t be done without the unquestioning compliance of the general public. But can we really blame the public for it considering the tactics of psychological warfare unleashed on them by the authorities to manipulate them into compliance? Psychological warfare which triggered the emotion of fear, and moulded them into sacrificial lambs under the guise of “doing their bit for the greater good”. The very same tactics the World Economic Forum now recommends authorities use to manipulate the same public into taking an experimental “vaccine”. ************ Source Published to The Liberty Beacon from EuropeReloaded.com •••• The Liberty Beacon Project is now expanding at a near exponential rate, and for this we are grateful and excited!

The European (EEA and non-EEA countries) database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, verified by European Medicines Agency (EMA), and they are now reporting 32,649 fatalities, and 3,003,296 injuries, following COVID-19 injections. A Health Impact News subscriber from Europe reminded us that this database maintained at EudraVigilance is only for countries in Europe who are part of the European Union (EU), which comprises 27 countries. The total number of countries in Europe is much higher, almost twice as many, numbering around 50. (There are some differences of opinion as to which countries are technically part of Europe.) So as high as these numbers are, they do NOT reflect all of Europe. The actual number in Europe who are reported dead or injured following COVID-19 shots would be much higher than what we are reporting here. The EudraVigilance database (EEA and non-EEA countries) reports that through December 4, 2021 there are 32,649 deaths and 3,003,296 injuries reported following injections of four experimental COVID-19 shots: COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE MODERNA (CX-024414) COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA (CHADOX1 NCOV-19) COVID-19 VACCINE JANSSEN (AD26.COV2.S) From the total of injuries recorded, almost half of them (1,409,643) are serious injuries. “Seriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as ‘serious’ if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.” A Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the four COVID-19 shots we are including here. It is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results. Since we have started publishing this, others from Europe have also calculated the numbers and confirmed the totals.* Here is the summary data through December 4, 2021.

A dictionary definition is, “Religion is belief in a god or gods and the activities that are connected with this belief, such as praying or worshipping in a building such as a church or temple.”","Religion is a belief system based on a combination of logic and faith, mostly beyond the realm of what can be proven scientifically. A dictionary definition is, “Religion is belief in a god or gods and the activities that are connected with this belief, such as praying or worshipping in a building such as a church or temple.” Or in simpler terms, religion can create order and meaning in a random and chaotic world. Religion is also strongly held and deeply personal, not something tossed aside based on the words of a government, politician, or celebrity. For many, politics has become a religion, and as a centuries-old etiquette rule advises, “Never discuss politics or religion in polite company.” Unfortunately, today, science has now become political and entered the realm of religion. For decades, communism was the primary religion of the left. The fall of the Soviet Union and socio-economic failures of Cuba, Venezuela, and other communist dictatorships steered the left toward a new god, Mother Earth, or simply the environment. This religion morphed from global cooling in the 1970s to global warming a decade later, now to climate change or extreme weather — normal cyclic events that have been a part of life on Planet Earth since long before humans existed. While climate change has been the excuse for massive tax-and-spend schemes of wealth redistribution and top-down population control, the movement was stalling as the fearmongering became less credible to much of the population. Time for replacing an environmental god with a deadly virus, whose treatment and control may achieve what global warming and climate change could not. The left treats both climate and COVID with the religious fervor of jihad. Religion has 7 basic elements . How are the religions of climate and COVID similar? Beliefs – The planet and civilization will be destroyed due to man-made global warming or a man-made (increasingly likely) virus. The left believes this with absolute certainty. Just speak with your liberal friends or listen to cable news for confirmation. Immediate and severe measures are necessary, or we are facing an extinction event, despite ample evidence to the contrary. Religious organization – Both climate and COVID are organized around fear, large powerful government organizations, and the media pushing and amplifying such fear, proposing new bureaucracies, or empowering existing ones to make totalitarian decisions confiscating both wealth and freedom. Emotions – Fear is the primary emotion for both belief systems. For climate, it is fear of starvation and an end to normal life. For COVID it’s fear of death from a virus with a greater than 99 percent survival rate. Emotional images are used, from a polar bear floating on an ice cap to a crowded emergency room or ICU, even if the photos are staged or have little to do with the issue at hand. Sacred objects – The climate movement has windmills, solar panels, and electric vehicles as their sacred objects with no acknowledgment that their religious icons are currently doing little to solve the supposed problem they are meant to fix. In COVID, the sacred objects are the almighty face mask, largely symbolic and previously acknowledged to be useless for a respiratory virus by Dr. Fauci and others. The vaccine syringe is another sacred object, worshipped by late-night political cranks like Stephen Colbert performing an embarrassing and insipid “vaccine dance” featuring dancing syringes. As if Colbert’s foolishness will change the minds of the vaccine-hesitant. Symbols – These can be lumped together with sacred objects. Add in the myriad “awareness ribbons” proudly displayed by those who care more about important issues than you do, and “I’m vaccinated” stickers or a “vaxed” necklace worn by New York’s new governor as she systematically shuts down her state. Sects – Several sects exist within these two movements. Both are populated largely by Democrats and leftists but also virtue-signaling Republicans who want to appear woke, hoping to avoid ostracization or cancellation. Examples include Senator Mitt Romney, once an uber capitalist, now willing to throw untold dollars at manufactured problems and causes to make sure the Washington Post and CNN don’t say mean things about him. There are other commonalities between climate and COVID, nicely compiled by physicist John Droz, Jr. Both pseudo religions use fear of an invisible enemy, a warming planet, or a virus, to make the public afraid and compliant. The fear is based on “situational science” which changes based on the narrative of the day. For example, global cooling changed to global warming, then to climate change when meaningful cooling or warming could not be verified or accurately modeled. With COVID, we went from “15 days to slow the spread” and “masks are unnecessary” to “vaccines are safe and effective” and “vaccines will return life to normal” with “the vaccinated don’t need to wear masks” to a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” to “vaccines don’t prevent infection or transmission, and only reduce the risk of hospitalization and death.” One would think the world is dealing with its first respiratory virus and vaccination program, given how fast everyone seems to be learning on the job. Prophets of doom and salvation spread the message, from Al Gore to Anthony Fauci, and profit often follows the prophet, as it does with some fabulously wealthy leaders of the mega-churches. Hypocrisy abounds as well. Green Al Gore’s home electricity bill is 20 times the national average. Dr. Fauci and others go maskless when it suits them or when the cameras are off while telling the rest of us to wear two masks. Scientific organizations are complicit in pushing their religions, from NOAA to the CDC, and the media happily joins the chorus as they are part of the religious congregations, even if in their private lives they behave otherwise. Think of CNN’s Chris Cuomo as an example. The religious zealots propose solutions that are profitable to favored political groups, from Solyndra’s solar panels to the big pharma vaccine makers. COVID vaccines created 9 new billionaires. Is Senator Elizabeth Warren scolding them, “You didn’t build that”? Proposed solutions are experimental and of limited benefit, carrying significant adverse effects, some of which make the problem worse. From rolling blackouts and rising gas prices to windmills chopping up birds on the climate side to endless lockdowns, vaccine mandates, mask rules, and business closures, destroying the health and lives of so many on the COVID side. Common sense, safe, and inexpensive solutions are castigated and dismissed, whether nuclear energy or ivermectin. All are tossed aside in favor of more expensive and potentially more harmful remedies that are not even solving the problem they are supposed to solve. China finds itself in the middle of both religions, as the world’s biggest polluter , now going on a “ coal spree ” and serving as the source as the original Wuhan coronavirus. The previously mentioned New York Governor Kathy Hochul confirmed the new COVID religion while recently speaking at a Brooklyn church. She claimed the vaccines were divinely inspired and that congregants were her “apostles”, taking the role of Jesus, urging everyone to get vaccinated. Perhaps Saint Kathy should check in with the Book of Matthew , “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.” Finally, both religions seek to undermine America, her economy, Constitution, and way of life, taking liberty and freedom away from Americans, replaced with a top-down command and control government dictating our every behavior. Globalism is the goal, a great reset, or a one-world government, controlled by the self-appointed elites who rule over the masses. This is hardly the message taught by most of the world’s great religions, but we are in a new world, with a new religion of the left, climate, and now COVID. Shout Hosanna, put on your mask, get in your electric car, and drive to the nearest vaccination center. Read more at American Thinker Be Social And Share!

The clergy stated that they are opposed to making vaccination “the basis of whether someone is allowed entry to a venue” as it “makes no logical sense in terms of protecting others.” “Further, since vaccines do not prevent infection per se even a vaccinated person could, in theory, carry and potentially pass on the virus, so to decide someone’s “safe non-spreader” status on the basis of proof of their immunity to disease is spurious.” Over the past few days in the UK, protests have taken place in London opposing the introduction of vaccine passports and the current Covid restrictions which continue to be forced onto the British public. In France, protests have erupted over the introduction of mandatory vaccine passports for entry to restaurants, pubs, and other public spaces. Whilst demonstrators were hit with water cannons and other non-lethal crowd control methods, some of the police joined in solidarity with the protestors. It seems that the pushback against these tyrannical measures is ramping up, suggesting that the Covid agenda could be the spark for a new liberty movement worldwide.

The regulator fears that up to 45,000 infected people might have been wrongly given the all clear. MailOnline has more . Immensa Health Clinic – awarded a £120million Government deal – is responsible for prosessing PCR tests taken at sites based mainly in the South West. But an investigation has found swabs sent to the lab may have been checked incorrectly since September 8, with infected Britons told they do not have the virus. Health chiefs said it had analysed more than 400,000 swabs since early last month, but the vast majority of these would have been negative. People who may have been given an incorrect result will be contacted in the coming days and asked to take another PCR test. Samples are being redirected to other laboratories. There are no technical issues with test kits themselves and people should continue to test as normal, officials said. West Berkshire council today urged everyone who got tested at one site in its area between October 3rd and 12th to get a second PCR test. It comes after workers at the lab on Wolverhampton University science park were filmed fighting and apparently drinking while on shift in January. There are concerns failures at the lab may be linked to a rising number of reports of faulty lateral flow tests in England. … Dr Will Welfare, the public health incident director at the UK Health Security Agency which replaced Public Health England, said an investigation had revealed concerns over the way the lab was analysing swabs. He said in a statement: “We have recently seen a rising number of positive LFD results subsequently testing negative on PCR. “As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. “We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation.” He added: “There is no evidence of any faults with LFD or PCR test kits themselves and the public should remain confident in using them and in other laboratory services currently provided. “If you get a positive LFD test, it’s important to make sure that you then get a follow up PCR test to confirm you have COVID-19. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, self-isolate and take a PCR test.” Professor Alan McNally, a geneticist at Birmingham University, warned that this could be just the “tip of a rather large iceberg”. Immensa Health Clinic won a £119 million Government contract in November last year to carry out PCR tests. This was not put out to tender, meaning other companies did not have a chance to bid for the deal. Worth reading in full . This isn’t the first time a PCR lab in receipt of tens of millions of pounds of Government money has been exposed as not fit for purpose. The Daily Sceptic ran a piece by a whistleblower about shortcomings at a Lighthouse Lab in Milton Keynes last November. By Toby Young / 15 October 2021 • 11.32 Immensa Health Clinic PCR Testing",1,-1

She deserves our thanks and gratitude. And here you can also read the document itself . In short, the Pfizer document (which was never supposed to see the light of day but was disclosed as part of a FOIA suit) describes the adverse effects from just the first three months of injections with the company’s COVID vaccine: 158,000 adverse events, 1223 deaths. In a half-sane world, this would have been more than enough to halt all injections and cancel the vaccine. TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/ I’ve queried two attorneys. They both looked at the Pfizer document and state they believe it’s authentic. The appendix of the Pfizer document is the most astonishing section. It’s beyond astonishing. It lists all the types of vaccine adverse events Pfizer logged—again, in just three months of injections. Page after page after page after page of types of adverse events. Each type of event cast in medical language, the language of the dead. The proponents of this technical-ese speak, as it were, from beyond the grave. They’re super-educated brainwashed zombies. It’s as if they’re listing and counting abstractions in an academic board game. The abstractions raise no concerns. In the document, no one is waving red flags. They’re all medical bean counters, keeping their books with precision. Make no mistake, these are the people who are operating the levers of society on a day-to-day basis, maiming and killing with a confident attitude that indicates they are beyond reproach. The very notion of reproach is foreign to them. Civilization is drowning. It’s drowning in a giant lake of TECHNIQUE. The uses to which technique is put have become irrelevant. Just follow procedure. Carry out assigned tasks. Pass along information. Report on results. And then you will have achieved immunity from blame. Or resist and rebel no matter what. These are the stakes. This is the war. Get ready. Buckle up.

A few hours later, none other than Pershing Square's Bill Ackman apparently read this take because shortly after he tweeted what we said, namely that "" while it is too early to have definitive data, early reported data suggest that the Omicron virus causes ‘mild to moderate’ symptoms (less severity) and is more transmissible. If this turns out to be true, this is bullish not bearish for markets.” Others quickly caught on to this view, including not just hedge fund managers but also respected physicians , in this case the top Russian scientist Anatoly Altshtein, a virologist at the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which pioneered Russia’s Sputnik V jab, and who also echoed what we said, namely that “we already see Omicron has many mutations, more than Delta. More than thirty in a single gene of its spike protein. This is too many, and it means the virus has an unstable genome. As a rule, this sort of infectious agent becomes less dangerous, because evolutionarily, an overwhelming number of mutations leads to a weakening of the virus’s ability to cause disease.” According to the professor, if this rule holds true, then Omicron would be fatal in only a small fraction of cases, and would become like other common seasonal infections. “We shouldn’t be afraid that the Omicron variant is spreading widely,” said Professor Altshtein, “but that it could turn out to be the most pathogenic variant, making infection worse.” The latest facts confirm this take: as we learned today (much to the chagrin of bulls), the first Omicron case was detected in San Francisco in a traveler who returned from South Africa on Nov 22. Yet while the variant clearly appears to be highly transmissable, what the media ignored to note is that the individual - who was fully vaccinated - had only mild symptoms that are improving . Hardly the extinction level event that the starved for clicks mainstream media is trying to make it out to be. So fast forward to today when none other than JPMorgan's head quant Marko Kolanovic - whose long running growth-to-value thesis just suffered a spectacular meltdown in recent days, also paraphrased what we said, and in a note whose title is oddly familiar , namely "" What if ""Nu"" variant Omicron ends up positive for risk? ""... ... reaches the same conclusion as us for the same two reasons: Omicron is i) more transmissable and ii) less severe, which means it will eventually crowd out the Delta and other dangerous variants, and could in fact ""accelerate the end of the pandemic."" Before we get to the punchline, a quick detour into how Kolanovic explains the violent stock rout observed in the past 4 days, which he attributes to two main sources of confusion: government responses and tranmissibility assessments, to wit: Which brings us to Kolanovic's punchline which, for what it's worth, is identical to ours: Of course, it goes without saying that Kolanovic's perpetual optimism is dictated by a simple overarching philosophy: he needs to always find a bullish spin in every situation, especially when JPM clients are surely calling him every hour and asking why the growth-to-value rotation he has been pitching so aggressively for the past year just imploded. The Croat admits as much: The bolded sentence doesn't surprise us: unlike the Marko Koalnovic of old who skeptically, rationally and diligently analyzed every possible outcome with a focus on the downside, ever since his promotions the head JPM quant has just one function - to spin every possible scenario into a positive one (which with the help of the Fed's $8+ trillion balance sheet wasn't all that difficult). As such, his attempts to spin Omicron as a positive event is hardly a shock. That said, for the very same reasons which we discussed first days ago, this is one time when Marko may actually be right and the next few days will reveal if that's the case.",1,-1

They also organize mass protests with millions of people throughout Europe. (Article republished from ) n Spain a group of called ‘Doctors for Truth’, made a similar statement during a press conference. Doctors for Information’ and ‘Doctors for Truth’ have joined forces with similar groups of practitioners around the world, in the ‘World Doctors Alliance’ (2A). This historic alliance connects more than one hundred thousand medical professionals around the world. They reveal how the pandemic is the greatest crime in history, and offer solid scientific evidence for this claim. They also take legal actions against governments who are playing along with this criminal operation. Similarly, the – a network of attorneys, medical experts, politicians, bankers, and many other professionals who are working together to expose the ‘Covid Crime’, and who are starting to build a new world of freedom. They want to make sure these kinds of worldwide scams, that destroy millions of lives, can never occur again. Why are thousands of medical experts worldwide saying the pandemic is a ‘global crime’? What do they know, that we don’t? Let’s have a look at some interesting facts… he new COVID-19 disease appeared in China towards the end of 2019. That’s why it was named COVID-19, which is an acronym for Data from the World Integrated Trade Solution, however, shows something astonishing: In 2017 and 2018 – two years before COVID-19 – hundreds of millions of PCR test kits for COVID-19 were distributed worldwide. Let this sink in for a second: literally hundreds of millions of COVID-19 test kits were exported and imported, all over the world, during 2017 and 2018. Hundreds of millions! The argument used to deny this discovery is that the label ‘COVID’19’ was only added in 2020. That however doesn’t hold up, since the very product code for these test kits is ‘COVID-19 Test Kit’. It also doesn’t change the fact that two years before the pandemic, suddenly virtually every nation in the world started distributing hundreds of millions of medical test kits that are specifically used for COVID-19. Even without the label COVID-19, it is extremely uncommon and strange, that the entire world suddenly imported and exported literally hundreds of millions of Medical Test Kits. What did they know? What were they preparing for? Why did the entire world explode in mass distribution of hundreds of millions of Medical Test Kits, right before the worldwide pandemic hit? In 2017, Anthony Fauci made a very strange prediction, with an even stranger certainty. With complete confidence, Fauci guaranteed that during the first term of President Trump, a surprise outbreak of an infectious disease would surely happen. Here’s what he said: (3) How could Fauci guarantee a surprise outbreak to happen during the first term of the Trump administration? What did he know, that we don’t? In 2018 Bill Gates publicly announced that a global pandemic was on its way, that could wipe out 30 million people. He said this would probably happen during the next decade. (4) Melinda Gates added that an engineered virus is humanity’s greatest threat, and also assured that this would hit humanity in the coming years. (5) Let their choice of words resound into your mind for a moment… ill Gates is the world’s number one vaccine dealer, who has doubled his fortune of 50 billion dollars to over 100 billion, simply by dealing in vaccines all over the world. He said this has been his ‘best business investment’ ever. A few months before the outbreak, Bill Gates organized an event in New York City, called Event 201. Guess what the event was all about? It was a . Shortly after this ‘exercise for a coronavirus pandemic’, Bill Gates tweeted: I’m particularly excited about what the next year could mean for one of the best buys in global health: vaccines. hink about this: the world’s no. 1 vaccine dealer a global pandemic to occur in the next few years, and his wife says we should all fear an engineered virus that is ‘on its way’. Then they organize an exercise for an imminent global pandemic and say vaccines will be the only solution. Next… Bill Gates tweets how excited he is about selling vaccines in the next year. Immediately after that, the announced pandemic breaks out. he next bit of information is particularly interesting because it shows how much information is available, for those who dare to do the research. Back in a musical artist with the peculiar name of Dr. Creep wrote a rap song called PANDEMIC. Nothing special about that, were it not that one of his lyrics reads: How is it possible that an unknown musician could accurately predict a coronavirus pandemic to occur seven years later? The song also predicted the riots that raged throughout America, during this pandemic: Again: how could a shady artist know, back in 2013, that in 2020 a coronavirus would sweep the earth, followed by mass rioting? His answer is interesting: et it? This man did research into what is commonly referred to as ‘conspiracy theories’. Stuff we are programmed to disregard as ‘nonsense’. But apparently those investigations aren’t always so stupid after all, since some of them accurately predicted that exactly in 2020 this pandemic and the riots would happen. Read more at: and",1,-1

But another phenomena is being reported: these symptoms are being reported among women who did NOT get the injections also, but have been around those who have. What’s going on?? Women say they are having heavier and more painful PERIODS since getting their COVID-19 vaccines – as several claim it has also messed up their monthly cycle by Daily Mail Excerpts: Several women say they have experienced heavier and more painful periods since getting the COVID-19 vaccine, with some also revealing that they have had breakthrough bleeding in the middle of a cycle after getting the shot. Dr. Kate Clancy , an associate professor at the University of Illinois , tweeted in February that she’d been hearing about people who had experienced changes in their menstruation since getting one or two vaccine shots. Her Twitter thread has prompted more women to share their own menstrual concerns, revealing their heavy flow, worsened cramps, and irregular timing since getting the jab — with one woman saying she spent 16 days bleeding after getting the Johnson & Johnson shot. Dr. Clancy first tweeted on February 24, but her thread has continued to find other Twitter users who are seeking out explanations for their symptoms. ‘A colleague told me she has heard from others that their periods were heavy post-vax,’ she wrote. ‘I’m curious whether other menstruators have noticed changes too? I’m a week and a half out from dose 1 of Moderna, got my period maybe a day or so early, and am gushing like I’m in my 20s again. ‘I’m on day 3 of my period and am still swapping out extra long overnight pads a few times a day. Typical for me at this time is maybe one or two regular pads (though extra absorbent, Always Infinity ones) for the whole day,’ she went on. ‘Does this have to do with the way the vax response is mounting a broader inflammatory response, possibly moreso because of the lipid nanoparticle or mRNA mechanism? Either way I am fascinated! Inflammation + tissue remodeling = extra bleedypants!’ she added. Soon, other Twitter users were chiming in with their own experiences. Read the full article at the Daily Mail . Teegan Braun – Facebook A conversation is taking place in big ways on multiple platforms and I think it’s an important one. Critically important. In my stories over the past 48 hours I have shared testimonies of women who have had various reactions and symptoms, in varying experiences, BOTH post V AND those who have NOT been V’d but have been around those who have. These women (and many men sharing experiences of wives, girlfriends or women they know), include bleeding, hemorrhaging, passing clots, delayed cycle, prolonged cycle, bleeding POST menopause, miscarriages, decidual casts, severe period cramping and abnormal pain, etc. The list is VAST and the influx of testimonies have been eye opening… Especially considering the majority of testimony is from women who have chosen not to be V’d, but have been around those who have….which speaks to shedding. These images below have been shared in a reactions group I am in, or via Kim Alberts Instagram, or sent directly to me in messages.

He cautioned that people should still take precautions, due to the coronavirus’ ability to mutate, but predicted a “period of quiet” following Omicron. “We anticipate there will be a level of quiet before Covid-19 may come back towards the end of the year, but not necessarily the pandemic,” he said. Kluge said a level of “global immunity” could be reached for a period of weeks or months because of a combination of the relatively high number of current infections, continued vaccination uptake, and the “lowering seasonality” aspect of the forthcoming Northern Hemisphere spring. The WHO’s Europe region, which covers 53 countries and territories, has seen a spike in Omicron cases, like much of the world. In the week ending January 18, the percentage of new infections from Omicron more than doubled, from 6.3% to 15%, according to health officials. The WHO said earlier this month that more than half the population of Europe could test positive for the newest variant in a matter of months, describing the contagion as a “new west to east tidal wave.” WHO chief Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has made it clear that the pandemic is “nowhere near over,” however. Speaking last week, he said Omicron had led to 18 million new infections across the globe over the course of just seven days, with numerous European countries seeing significant rises in case numbers as a result. “Make no mistake, Omicron is causing hospitalizations and deaths, and even the less severe cases are inundating health facilities,” he said.

LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE TO OUR PODCAST Adams, who became mayor at the start of the year, has been adamant about keeping schools open. He said he is making decisions about COVID “based on facts, not fear,” and that he plans to adjust his strategy as needed. “COVID is a formidable opponent that pivots and shifts,” Adams said. “I’m going to do that.” He argued schools are the safest place for children and said there’s no guarantee a child won’t go outdoors or out and about even if schools shutter. Beyond that, Adams mentioned the “trauma of not having socialization” as yet another factor that comes along with school closures. “Strand after strand, we can’t continue to stop our children from developing socially and academically, and the support that they need,” he said. “So, we have to learn how to live with COVID and live with COVID with a safe way, and that’s what I’m going to do. I’m not going to allow the hysteria to prevent the future of my children.” Watch Adams make these proclamations in the segment: ""The safest place for children right now is in a school,"" NYC Mayor Eric Adams says on his standoff with the city's largest teachers' union on remote learning.

Geoffrey Young, an FBI special agent, got the shot on April 17th. Within hours, Geoffrey had several symptoms including a headache and nausea. His wife checked on him in bed many times because he was rustling around, but he seemed fine, and they thought the side effects were normal. The next time she saw him several hours later, he was blue, and his arm stretched out hanging off the bed. He wasn’t breathing and he was eventually pronounced dead. “My husband very much so believed in freedom,” his wife, Ona, said in an Instagram video . “So much so that he went to work every day to support our freedoms, and to fight for our freedoms. He trusted science, he went and got his shot. He did before it was told that you have to go get this, he did. And he would giggle at me and tell me ‘Ona, you’re being silly, it’s okay. Don’t worry about it. Millions of people are getting them, and they’re fine. We’re gonna be okay.’ Watch the video: Read the full article at The COVID World .

Life would be almost normal.”","The Los Angeles Board of Education has scheduled a vote for Thursday that will likely approve a COVID vaccine mandate for its ‘eligible’ students, the LA Times reports . LA Unified School District is the second-largest school system in the nation and already has high hopes for mandating the jabs for children who have a near-zero risk of death from COVID-19, further stating: “The Los Angeles Unified Board of Education will vote at their next meeting on whether to mandate vaccines for all eligible students. Science clearly shows that vaccinations are an essential part of protecting our communities. Further details will be forthcoming after the vote.” Approval of a vaccine mandate for students will likely result in a new string of lawsuits, LA Unified officials also told The Times . SEE ALSO: Youth and COVID Vaccines: All Risk, Zero Benefit All known data and reporting reveals that there is actually no medical or public health case for the mass vaccination of children and young people, or for coercive or restrictive measures affecting those who are unvaccinated. It is a case of all risk with zero benefit. Despite all of this, board members can’t contain their excitement for the impending vaccine mandate: “Personally I think we should do so as soon as possible” “Wow! Life would be almost normal.” “We are living in a global pandemic, so if a vaccine can save and protect a student’s life, how is requiring students that are eligible for the vaccine any different than what is already being done?” Students who don’t comply with the mandate could spend another lost year of school on Zoom. Or much worse, either become ‘chronically absent’ or just drop out altogether. This actually happened with thousands of students over the last two years in the same LA Unified School District. Before they vote, every LA School Board member should be forced to watch “Ten reasons why children and young people should not get the COVID-19 vaccines” by Abir Ballan, brought to life by film creators Kate Wand and WG Gervais: ﻿ READ MORE VACCINE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Vaccine Files PLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE Share Tweet",1,-1

Now conclusions have been reached, Pfizer is the most effective killer of all the other COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer by far created the highest number of victims, both dead and alive but permanently damaged such as given paralysis, myocarditis, convulsions, blood clots and many other health problems.","As all of you may know by now, no proper trials have been conducted with these vaccines, so the fist 2 doses on the masses of the public…. those were in fact the actual trials. Now conclusions have been reached, Pfizer is the most effective killer of all the other COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer by far created the highest number of victims, both dead and alive but permanently damaged such as given paralysis, myocarditis, convulsions, blood clots and many other health problems. The European Eudravigilance data shows that out of 28.103 Europeans killed and 2,637,525 permanently incapacitated by the COVID-19 vaccines, 13,271 were killed and 1,168,872 were permanently injured by Pfizer alone. That is nearly 50%…. even though in Europe Pfizer was not used as much as AstraZeneca was a lot more used… but that’s the problem, even though AstraZeneca was used more in Europe than Pfizer, sadly for the evil Satanic oligarchy that rules over us, AstraZeneca “only” managed to kill 5,767 Europeans while Johnson & Johnson “only” claimed the life of 1,522 Europeans… The American VAERS system tells a similar story with Pfizer being top killer by far but the difference is that in USA, most Americans went for Pfizer and only a few chose Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, while AstraZeneca is not even available in USA as its not accepted by the American authorities as a vaccine. So here’s where severe problems being. Even though Europe imported and used not 1 but 3 American vaccines: Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, Europe only has 1 single vaccine: AstraZeneca. Europe doesn’t have a second one like America has 3 or even Russia has 2 or 3, but even though Europe has only 1, even that single one, America refused to authorize for use in their country or even accept Americans injected with AstraZeneca abroad as “vaccinated”. The situation is so bad, that America labels people vaccinated with AstraZeneca as “unvaccinated” as if they were injected with water or normal saline… so fair trade as Trump used to say? Off the window with fair trade… Europe should have not allowed any American vaccines let alone 3, after America refused to return the favor. Even if America would have imported AstraZeneca, it wouldn’t even have had a fair chance as it was 1 competing against 3 in a foreign patriotic country. Americans are generally patriotic, only a few would have taken “some British vaccine” over American vaccines but at least it would have shown to the world and the public that there is some fairness in all of this but there isn’t. Russia’s Sputnik-V suffered a similar fate in both Europe and America. So now that the trials are over, the conclusions have been drawn and not only the other vaccines have been discriminated from the very beginning but now they are being canceled altogether. The winner has been chosen and dictated upon the entire world as the only acceptable vaccine: Pfizer (and possibly also Moderna but we don’t know) Notice how they pushed aside all the viral vectors: AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Sputnik-V. AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have been plagued with media bashing and defamation from the beginning about a few blood clots while Pfizer created 100 times more blood clots and deaths and the media never reported about them. Moderna is similar to Pfizer, mRNA, the most destructive technology there is, so why is Moderna also being pushed aside? We don’t really know, because even though Moderna was used a lot less in Europe than Pfizer, it managed to kill 7,543 Europeans which kinda makes Moderna a more efficient killer but still they are going with Pfizer ONLY. Why? Who really knows? Maybe because their CEO is a Jew…? Anyway how do we know that the trials are over and Pfizer has been declared as the winner? There aren’t any news reports or official statements from any governments about this, this is just a conclusion that we have reached, but how did we reach this conclusion? It is simple, really. In Europe, Canada and Australia they have begun demanding a 3rd shot, a booster, if you don’t take it, you are considered “unvaccinated” and your vaccination status expires and thus you loose your rights again until you take the booster. Guess what the booster is……………. PFIZER for everybody. People who took the 2 doses of AstraZeneca, instead of being given a 3rd AstraZenaca shot, they are forced to take mRNA, either Pfizer or Moderna. In Europe, for now, both mRNA’s are accepted as boosters, either Pfizer or Moderna while in Canada and Australia only Pfizer is accepted as booster and they are thinking about allowing Moderna too but looking at how things are going, they might all push Moderna aside and leave only Pfizer as they only available vaccine and infinite boosters. Same story in Israel, only Pfizer is allowed which is very telling for what’s to come for the rest of the world. No other vaccine is accepted as booster regardless of what you took prior. Even in the case of Johnson & Johnson which was falsely advertised by the company, the media and the governments as a traditional “one dose and you’re done forever!” they are now demanding Pfizer boosters. We don’t know for sure yet if Moderna will be allowed to continue or not, maybe they will allow it for the sake of some appearances like “hey there’s competition, you still have a choice, you have 2 options, you can choose mRNA poison A or mRNA poison B” or maybe they don’t give a shit about face anymore now that they have total power and maybe they will just go with Pfizer-only. This remains to be seen but regardless of if they allow Moderna or not, Moderna and Pfizer are basically the same product under a different name. They are both mRNA, the most destructive form known to mankind, way worse than viral vectors. The mRNA vaccines have taken the lives of more people than all other vaccines combined, ever, since the invention of the vaccine. So if you thought you could get away from mRNA by taking AstraZeneca, Sputnik-V or Johnson & Johnson, well mRNA is now being FORCED on everybody in the form of “boosters”. What this means is that the experiment is over, the trial is over, they got the data that they needed and they drew the conclusion that viral vectors are not efficient enough for massive population reduction, thus the governments of the world have all been instructed to go with mRNA only as boosters, preferably, only Pfizer! The boosters are going to be the real thing, what they did until now with the 2 doses, they experimented, different lots from the same company sent around the world had different ingredients and quantities of the ingredients, in order to study the results. If you think this is conspiracy theory, then clearly you have logic problems, you are unable to connect the dots. This might not be the case in Asia, including Russia. The majority of Asian countries will probably not go with Pfizer as the only booster but who knows? We will see… Please wait...

I’m going to leave that to the military,” Biden told NBC News’ Craig Melvin in an interview that aired Friday, in response to a question on whether he would mandate the vaccine for U.S. service members once it is fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Significant Jump in Reported Injuries, Deaths After COVID Vaccine Compared to Last Week The Defender reported : Data released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the number of injuries and deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following COVID vaccines showed a significant jump in reports of injuries and deaths compared with last week’s numbers . … Every Friday, VAERS makes public all vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date, usually about a week prior to the release date. Today’s data show that between Dec. 14, 2020 and April 23, a total of 118,902 total adverse events were reported to VAERS, including 3,544 deaths — an increase of 358 over the previous week — and 12,619 serious injuries , up 2,467 since last week. 3 Reasons Miami School Might Be Right About Asking Teachers Not to Get COVID Vaccine GreenMedInfo reported : Centner Academy, a private school in Miami, has made international headlines for directing its employees who have not yet received the experimental COVID-19 vaccine , to wait until the end of the school year, as a precautionary step to protect the health of their school community, given both concerning new anecdotal reports that the vaccinated can adversely affect the health of the un-vaccinated, and that clinical safety and efficacy data for the mRNA vaccines will not be completed until sometime in 2023. Thus far, mainstream media reporting has focused and railed against the following statement made by Leila Centner, co-founder and CEO of Centner Academy, to her employees (in an internal email later leaked to the press) as being the most controversial and contestable: “Tens of thousands of women all over the world have recently been reporting adverse reproductive issues simply from being in close proximity with those who have received any one of the COVID-19 injections, e.g., irregular menses, bleeding, miscarriages, post-menopausal hemorrhaging and amenorrhea (complete loss of menstruation)…” Pfizer, BioNtech Seek EU’s Ok to Use COVID Vaccine on Kids AP News reported : Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech have submitted a request to the European drug regulator for the approval of their coronavirus vaccine to be extended to include children 12 to 15 years old, in a move that could offer younger and less at-risk populations in Europe access to the shot for the first time. In a statement Friday, the two pharmaceuticals said their submission to the European Medicines Agency is based on an advanced study in more than 2,000 adolescents that showed their vaccine to be safe and effective. The children will continue to be monitored for longer-term protection and safety for another two years. In Wake of Emergent Biosolutions’ Vaccine Problems, CEO’s Stock Trades Come Into Focus ABC News reported : Standing alongside Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan at their Baltimore-area plant, Emergent CEO Robert Kramer boasted about the biotech firm’s role as “one of the key suppliers” helping to produce two promising COVID-19 vaccines , and its “valuable contribution to society in being able to make hundreds of millions of doses available.” … What investors say they were not told: Emergent had at that time discarded vaccine ingredients slated for millions of Johnson & Johnson doses due to a string of quality control errors. And that on Feb. 8, nearly six weeks before Emergent’s lab errors became public, Kramer had completed a weeks-long stock transaction that netted him millions of dollars — and that later saved him millions more when the company’s stock tumbled upon news of its failures, securities filings show. AstraZeneca Struggles With Data Needed for COVID-19 Vaccine’s Approval The Wall Street Journal reported : AstraZeneca PLC executives have struggled to pull together the full data necessary to apply for U.S. approval of its COVID-19 shot, according to people familiar with the matter, further delaying its efforts to secure the Food and Drug Administration’s go-ahead. The company said last month that it would apply for what is known as emergency use authorization for its vaccine by mid-April. It has recently told U.S. officials it might need until mid-May to finish its application for an FDA review, according to one of these people. Inovio Sinks 26% After U.S. Government Decides to Discontinue Funding for Next Phase of COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Business Insider reported : The biotech company said it was informed that it will lose federal financial support for the phase three segment of its Innovate trial for INO-4800. The DNA vaccine candidate is aimed at preventing infection from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 disease. “The decision results from the changing environment of COVID-19 with the rapid deployment of vaccines,” said Inovio in a statement. “This decision is not a reflection of the awardee or product, rather a fast-moving environment associated with the former Operation Warp Speed on decisions related to future products.” Joe Rogan Clarified His Controversial Comments About the COVID-19 Vaccine Men’s Health reported : After facing a backlash that reached all the way to Dr. Anthony Fauci , podcaster Joe Rogan has tried to clarify his recent comments about the COVID-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, he hasn’t cleared up much other than, as he puts it, “I’m not a respected source of information — even for me.” The controversy began when, on a recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, Rogan said that while he believes the vaccine is safe, he doesn’t think young, healthy people need it. “If you’re like 21 years old, and you say to me, ‘Should I get vaccinated?’ I’ll go, ‘No,'” he said. AstraZeneca COVID Vaccine Sales Hit $275 MN in First Quarter News.com.au reported : British pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca said Friday that its COVID vaccine generated $275 million (227 million euros) in sales in the first quarter, as its chief executive defended the company’s performance in the face of EU legal action. This is the first time that the company has disclosed figures from sales of one of the world’s leading vaccines, which it sells on a not-for-profit basis. However, public confidence in the jab has been dented over links to very rare blood clots , and the company is also mired in a legal fight with the EU over delivery shortfalls. The Latest: India Sets Record of 386,000 Daily Virus Cases Chron reported : India has set another global record with 386,452 daily coronavirus cases . The Health Ministry on Friday also reported 3,498 deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 208,330. Experts believe both figures are an undercount, but it’s unclear by how much. India’s pandemic response has been marred by insufficient data. An online appeal — signed by over 350 scientists Friday afternoon — asks the government to release data about the sequencing of virus variants, testing, recovered patients and how people were responding to vaccines.",1,4

Dr. Alejandra Gurtman, vice president of vaccine clinical research and development at Pfizer, appeared along with representatives from other major drugmakers to talk data and timelines behind pediatric clinical trials Thursday during a Johns Hopkins University-University of Washington virtual symposium. Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is currently authorized for use in individuals aged 12 and older. “With this data, we felt very comfortable to move down in age,” Gurtman said, speaking to the trials involving participants aged 6 months to 11 years. The trials involved a so-called dose de-escalation strategy to safely determine the appropriate dosage in each age group. The company previously announced it selected lower dosages of vaccine for kids younger than 11 than the volume given to shot recipients ages 12 and older. For children ages 5-11 the vaccine will be given at a 10 microgram (ug) dose level, while those younger than 5 down to 6 months will receive a 3 ug dose level. Gurtman said Pfizer initiated late-stage trials for all three age groups, with studies taking place in the U.S., Poland, Spain and Finland. She noted plans to vaccinate 4,500 participants with two doses spaced 21 days apart. – READ MORE Listen to the insightful Thomas Paine Podcast Below -- Previous Article California’s Budget Will Give Illegal Aliens Free Health Care Next Article Broadway Hit Hamilton Could Get Up to $50 Million Federal Bailout",1,-1

The document is called Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings and was originally published on the CDC’s official website on July 26, 2020. The purpose of the strategy document is “to reduce the number of severe COVID-19 cases by limiting contact between individuals at higher risk of developing severe disease (“high-risk”) and the general population (“low-risk”).” According to the CDC, in order to achieve this, “High-risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to safe or “green zones” established at the household, neighborhood, camp/sector or community level depending on the context and setting. They would have minimal contact with family members and other low-risk residents.” The shielding approach would take “high-risk” individuals, meaning older people or people with underlying health conditions, and set about “physically separating high-risk individuals from the general population.” These high-risk individuals would be relocated to “camps ,” meaning “shelters such as schools, community buildings” where as many as 50 individuals would be held in each “green zone” where “no movement into or outside the green zone” would be allowed. The document takes into account considerations on hosuing “different ethnicities, socio-cultural groups, or religions” within such “green zones”. “Isolation/ separation from family members, loss of freedom and personal interactions may require additional psychosocial support structures/ systems,” states the document, noting that those who are isolated may face “stigmatization.” The summary at the end of the document warns that “compliance” may be an issue when isolating people in such a manner because while “the shielding approach is not meant to be coercive, it may appear forced or be misunderstood in humanitarian settings.” Commentator Candace Owens didn’t hold back when expressing her concerns about the implications of the document: “Holy shit. The CDC actually put together a document to discuss putting high risk people into camps to “shield” low risk people from them,” she tweeted. “No — this is not a joke, and yes, every single person who has made a reference to 1930’s Germany is vindicated.” Much more on the subject here: Official CDC Documents: Locking Up Healthy People In Labor Camps .

He also said government health and regulatory agencies are not being transparent about the vaccines’ safety.","In an interview Tuesday with the Centre for Research on Globalization, Dr. Peter McCullough discussed a wide range of issues related to the COVID vaccines , including how one of his own patients died from the vaccine. McCullough also said government health and regulatory agencies are not being transparent about the vaccines’ safety. “I’m a doctor,” McCullough said. “I’m an internist and cardiologist. I just came from the hospital, and in my personal practice, I see patients a few days a week in the office. So believe me when I say I’ve had a woman die of the COVID-19 vaccine.” ORDER TODAY: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s New Book — 'The Real Anthony Fauci' McCullough said: “She had shot number one. She had shot number two. After shot number two, she developed blood clots throughout her body. She required hospitalization and intravenous blood thinners. She was ravaged and had serious neurological damage … the next month I get a call from the Dallas coroner’s office saying she’s been found dead at home.” McCullough said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “have their marching orders to execute this [vaccination] program,” and that regular safety reports and honesty “would only cause problems” for such a program. McCullough said: “They’re not telling us anything, they literally are blindsiding us with no transparency, and now Americans are scared to death. And because of these giant safety concerns , and the lack of transparency, we’re at an impasse … you can feel the tension in America. People are walking off the job, they don’t want to lose their jobs, but they don’t want to be hurt, or worse, die from the vaccine.” McCullough also stressed the importance of early treatment when dealing with COVID and how no doctor should be ridiculed for prescribing FDA emergency-use-approved monoclonal antibody treatments because “[they] are just as approved as the vaccines.” He highlighted how comedian Joe Rogan used monoclonal antibodies when he was diagnosed with the virus, as did former President Donald Trump. “This is not renegade medicine, this is the standard of care,” McCullough said. “And it’s much safer than the vaccine.”",1,-1

I’ve been ‘fact-checked’ again. This time by the oracles at a website called ‘ Logically ‘, which I can only assume was a name chosen ironically. The claim they are ‘fact-checking’ is “COVID-19 vaccines don’t work because most people in U.K. hospitals with the virus are vaccinated”, which is a bad start since it’s not a claim I make in the article in question , or indeed anywhere. In fact, in the article I state that on current data the vaccines appear to “protect people well against severe disease and death”, meaning the ‘fact check’ is aiming at a straw man that bears no relation to the piece. Having stuffed her target full of straw, the author ‘Pallavi’ spends most of her ‘fact check’ wholly missing the target. Alleging that my article “fails to disclose all the details mentioned in the [UKHSA] report, thereby misrepresenting official data and promoting vaccine misinformation”, she points out that the UKHSA cautions against using the raw data to estimate vaccine effectiveness. Indeed it does, and in the article in question I do not use the raw data to estimate vaccine effectiveness. The article is not about vaccine effectiveness. It is responding to a claim in a Guardian article that “in hospital, COVID-19 has largely become a disease of the unvaccinated”. It is making the point that, according to official data, 71% of adult Covid hospital patients and 82% of Covid deaths in the month ending November 14th were in vaccinated people – which is indisputable, and the ‘fact check’ does not dispute it. The point was not to estimate vaccine effectiveness from these figures – to do that we’d need to take into account the proportions vaccinated and unvaccinated, at a minimum – but to counter the claim that “in hospital, COVID-19 has largely become a disease of the unvaccinated”. In the course of supposedly refuting my errors the ‘fact check’ even quotes from “a recent report by the Official [sic] for National Statistics” which claims that “the age-adjusted risk of deaths involving COVID-19 between January and September 2021 was 32 times greater in unvaccinated people than fully vaccinated people”. This is the same ONS report that the U.K. Statistics Authority publicly criticised for being misleading in its use of statistics for making precisely that claim. Pallavi writes that “the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a lot of potentially dangerous misinformation”, and, libellously, refers to the Daily Sceptic as “a website that often propagates COVID-19 misinformation”. Hmm, unlike Logically , which publishes ‘fact checks’ that attack straw men and cite discredited reports. Meanwhile, the Sunday Times has added its authority to the Guardian ‘s unsubstantiated claims about hospitals being deluged with unvaccinated Covid patients. It published an article today stating that intensive care beds are “filled with unvaccinated Covid patients”. The paper quotes Professor Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England, saying: “Data shows that the overwhelming majority of people admitted to intensive care with Covid are not fully vaccinated. Since July one in four critical beds have been consistently occupied by a Covid patient, with the latest statistics available showing three quarters of them are unvaccinated.” What “data” and “latest statistics” is Powis referring to? The Sunday Times article containing his quote doesn’t say, but if you click on the words “overwhelming majority” it takes you to another piece in today’s paper, this one by Dr. Rachel Clarke. The subhead of that article is “Some 75% of those suffocating in intensive care with the coronavirus are unvaccinated” and she repeats this claim in her piece, stating: “Of the Covid patients treated in intensive care in recent months, the majority – nearly 75% according to the latest data – have chosen not to be vaccinated.” Earlier today, Toby asked Rachel Clarke on Twitter if she could point him towards the “data” she’s referring to and she replied by citing the latest ICNARC report. Of course. It’s the latest @ICNARC report, published last week (see their pinned tweet). You’ll also find NHSE data referred to by @NHSEnglandNMD in the accompanying piece here: https://t.co/e70I137V4N — Rachel Clarke (@doctor_oxford) November 28, 2021 Is this the data both she and Professor Powis are referring to or just Dr. Clarke? A similar from Toby to Stephen Powis went unanswered, but it’s not unreasonable to assume they’re both citing the latest ICNARC report , not least because the latest one includes for the first time a breakdown of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients receiving critical care in English NHS hospitals. (Clarke refers to separate NHSE data showing the same thing, but I can’t find anything on the internet.) Now there’s a slight problem with the ICNARC data Clarke cites, which is that it only covers the period May 1st to July 31st. So is the data for May 1st to July 31st what Professor Powis means by “since July” and what Dr. Clarke means by “recent months”? The problem with extrapolating from this ICNARC data to make sweeping statements about the current ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated Covid patients in ICU – as the Sunday Times subhead does and Dr. Clarke does, and Professor Powis appears to – is that it stops before the Delta wave gets properly underway and before the surge in infections in the vaccinated over the summer, when the epidemic became dominated by vaccinated people . Covid ICU patients in England (UK Government) If this is what’s going on, it’s reminiscent of the ‘sleight of hand’ by NHS England chief Amanda Pritchard earlier this month, when she claimed that : “We have had 14 times the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 than we saw this time last year.” It quickly turned out that by “this time last year” she was referring to August rather than October or November, and was widely ridiculed for such an obviously incorrect and scaremongering statement when Covid hospital admissions at the time were plainly lower than in autumn 2020. She never apologised and instead tried to make it look like she was misunderstood , which, if Powis’s latest intervention is of a similar kind, suggests there may be no intention in the upper echelons of the health service to communicate clearly and accurately about the current risks posed by the virus. In fact, given the data from UKHSA over the autumn showing a higher proportion of Covid hospitalisations and deaths in the vaccinated (67% and 82% respectively in the week 46 report), it seems most unlikely that three quarters of Covid ICU patients in the same reporting period were unvaccinated. Why, though, do we not have data in the public domain more recent than July so we can see for ourselves rather than having to extrapolate and speculate? We have up-to-date data on hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status, so why doesn’t the UKHSA add a column to its table for ICU admissions as well? The biggest problem with Powis’s statement is not that it appears to be a misleading way of communicating statistics, but that it is being used against the unvaccinated in what seems to be a concerted effort to turn them into scapegoats and pariahs. “These are beds that would have historically been used to provide life-saving surgeries for the most seriously ill patients,” he says. This echoes the words of the anonymous medic in the Guardian last week : “If everyone got vaccinated, hospitals would be under much less pressure; this is beyond debate. Your wait for your clinic appointment/operation/diagnostic test/A&E department would be shorter. Your ambulance would arrive sooner. Reports of the pressure on the NHS are not exaggerated, I promise you. … Most of the resources that we are devoting to Covid in hospital are now being spent on the unvaccinated.” This is an ugly and dangerous road. Not only is there currently no publicly available data to back up these assertions – at least, nothing more recent than July 31st – but even if there was it would be no excuse to demonise and delegitimise the minority who, for whatever reason, remain unvaccinated. Our health service chiefs, and the journalists who report on their comments, need to do better than this.

The poll found that 52% of Americans believe the lab leak hypothesis, once derided as a fringe “conspiracy theory,” including 59% of Republicans and 52% of Democrats. Bipartisan support for the theory is highly unusual, with poll designer Bob Blendon commenting, “Usually, our polls find a big split between Republicans and Democrats, so this is unique.” Indeed, for many months the media and social media networks characterized the whole idea as a dangerous conspiracy theory and those who promoted it were censored and deplatformed. In June 2020, Vice President Kamala Harris even claimed Donald Trump’s advocacy of the theory represented “racist and xenophobic rhetoric against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants directly puts their lives at risk.” As we previously highlighted , Dr. Peter Daszak, President of the EcoHealth Alliance, a group that has extensive ties to the Wuhan lab gain of function research, thanked Dr. Anthony Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory early on in the pandemic. Daszak was also tasked by Facebook with ‘fact-checking’ (censoring) information related to the hypothesis, while Google, which via YouTube also censored information about the theory, also funded Daszak’s virus research. The Wuhan lab leak issue once again underscores how ‘fact-checkers’, media outlets and Silicon Valley giants shouldn’t be handed monopoly power to dictate reality. By blacklisting content related to the lab leak theory up until just a few months ago, those entities may well have been complicit in facilitating one of the biggest cover-ups in modern history. * * * Brand new merch now available!

Now Israel will go so far as to conduct ""genetic scanning"" for travelers arriving in the country . It's considered a huge and experimental high tech step in screening inbound passengers for coronavirus infections at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett made the announcement at a meeting of his cabinet on Sunday, confirming plans to eventually deploy it at Ben Gurion. ""We are working on a scanning system for everyone who comes into Israel,"" Bennett said . The statements were reportedly not intended to be made public, but were leaked to local Israeli media. ""Israel will thus become the radar for the virus,"" he added. However, no further details on how the 'genetic scanning' will work were given, nor whether there might be an opt-out mechanism. Thus a Covid passport, which Israel calls its ""green pass"" - may be linked to an eventual regimen of forced genetic testing at international travel points. The technology, which will no doubt be hugely controversial given privacy concerns, is being discussed as part of Israeli efforts to keep further Covid variants from entering the country, as The Times of Israel describes : Conventionally since the start of the pandemic airports have often monitored passengers' temperatures with a quick and simple thermometer scan of their foreheads, but Israeli health officials are now seeking a method which might given greater certitude over whether someone has the virus or not, and especially whether they are carrying a variant. Again though it remains unclear precisely how the genetic scanning will work, it brings up the question over just what genetic data/DNA will be preserved on each individual. The initiative suggests that for any foreign traveler entering Israel, they will have to agree to hand over their personal genetic data to potentially be stored by the Israeli government for all time.",1,-1

In case you missed it, two of our favorite pop culture queens took the small screen together last week. Trisha Yearwood visited The Kelly Clarkson Show , and while the two caught up, Yearwood reflected on her experience with COVID-19 . She contracted the virus in February and two months later, still can’t taste or smell anything. The topic came up when Clarkson noted that Yearwood has lost weight. The country singer first admitted to wearing Spanx, but added: “I lost my taste and smell, so food is kind of different right now.” She noticed the lack of senses when her husband, Garth Brooks , gave her coffee that she thought was weak. (Yes, he makes her coffee every morning .) “About five days in [to COVID], I’m like, ‘Honey,’” she laughed. “This is weak coffee... I love you, but did you put coffee in here?’ It was just like that.” Clarkson was surprised to hear that Yearwood still hadn’t fully regained her senses. The “Walkaway Joe” singer nodded, adding, “[It’s been] about eight weeks.” This content is imported from YouTube.

And now, eating is a totally new experience. “It’s really weird, I think this is how normal people eat,” she said. “So I think they eat when they’re hungry... and then they stop when they’re full.” And because she can’t really determine flavor, she said “it’s all about texture” now, which is odd for someone who loves to cook and has her own cooking show . “I can tell if something’s spicy, that’s about it,” Yearwood told Clarkson. “So now when I cook I just ask Garth to tell me if it needs more salt and pepper. It’s the weirdest thing.” Yearwood is still hopeful her senses will return, but unfortunately, there’s no way to know when that will happen. Experts have previously told Prevention that the recovery time varies for everyone who experiences the symptom. This content is imported from Instagram.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Trisha Yearwood (@trishayearwood) Data released from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) found that, in COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell, 27% had “some improvement” within about seven days, while most were better within 10 days. “Some people get partial function back and some get complete function back,” Eric Holbrook, M.D. , director of rhinology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and associate professor in Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery at Harvard Medical School previously told Prevention . “Some don’t recover at all. They can have a complete smell loss and never regain function.” He notes that scent training —the process of exposing yourself to various strong smells over a period of time—can be helpful. As far as who will be the most impacted in the long-run, he said “it’s very hard to tell,” adding: “The only thing we can say is that if, during the year, a patient starts noticing some improvement, that’s a good sign.” Go here to join Prevention Premium (our best value, all-access plan), subscribe to the magazine, or get digital-only access.

However, this is only on the grounds that children undergo regular COVID-19 testing and follow mask mandates now extended into classrooms as well as common areas. All of which comes at a cost, both to the health and wellbeing of the children as well siphoning a whopping £78 million from tax-payers money. But are these restrictions necessary? Research scientists from the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College, London, suggest not, because of the extremely low SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates in schools. Kids — fancy poking your brains? Some people are rightly concerned that the improper use of nasal swabs used in PCR or lateral flow testing may result in damage to the delicate membrane protecting the brain. But if you were to believe the fact-checkers , you’d assume this is nothing more than a conspiracy theory. But as has been demonstrated in many other instances, the fact checkers have got it wrong again. There is a risk — and that risk gets greater as more and more untrained people (now including children) administer their own swabs. In October 2020, a case report was published in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery detailing the case of a woman whose brain membrane was pierced by a COVID test swab resulting in the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. A second woman in the U.S. recently had a similar experience . Assessing the use of nasal swabs, researchers publishing in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery issued warnings about the risks for the millions who are now routinely going to undergo tests, especially from inexpertly administered nasal swabs. And who’s administering the nasal swabs in schools? The schoolchildren themselves ! Let’s hope that when kids do it wrong, it’s because they don’t go deep enough — not too deep. What no one seems to be being told is that the cribriform plate, the significant part that separates the brain from the nasal cavity is a delicate, soft, honey-comb or sieve-like structure that is thin and narrow with tiny perforations. This is why it’s a perfect site for endoscopic transnasal skull-based surgery. But clearly it’s proven nonsense to suggest someone inept at wielding a nasal swab can’t push their swab into their brain. Why lateral flow testing in schools is deeply misleading — and a waste of public money Nearly 57 million lateral flow test (LFT) kits have been delivered to schools in the UK. Concerns have been leveled at their accuracy due to the number of false positive results they return. Conversely, there are also concerns over the high levels of false negatives, although this is less of an issue as true negative rates are far lower than is generally thought. Views around the use of mass testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 are mixed with concerns that mass testing does not prevent transmission of the virus . Confusion reigns in terms of positive tests. If a child tests positive at home and a subsequent PCR test comes back negative that child can return to school. However, if a positive LFT test has been undertaken on school premises the pupil and their contacts will have to self-isolate whether or not they have a negative PCR test as the government considers the chances of the LFT test being a false positive as minimal.

We have previously discussed the problems with PCR testing and the significantly increased likelihood of a test returning a positive result when prevalence of the virus in the community is low. The same problem applies to lateral flow tests. To illustrate this we plugged in the sensitivity and specificity data (77.8% and 99.68% respectively) from the Innova rapid flow test into the MedCalc Diagnostic test evaluation calculator . The aims were to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) (i.e., the probability that SARS-VoV-2 is present when the test is positive) and the negative predictive value (NPV) (i.e., the probability that SARS-CoV-2 is not present when the test is negative) taking into account the low prevalence (amount) of infection in a given population. This is important because, as we explained in our ‘Casedemic’ piece that critiqued PCR tests , Bayesian theory makes it essential that we take into account prevalence when considering the false positive and negative rates of any diagnostic test. A key fact that the UK’s health minister, Matt Hancock, just can’t seem to wrap his head around — or chooses not to. We’ve used three prevalence rates: 0.14% (taken from NHS Test & Trace data ), then halved that (0.07%) and doubled it (0.28%), to take into account variation, as prevalence is something of a moving feast. At these prevalences, you’ll find much lower positive predictive values (PPVs) than claims around accuracy being made by the government. For the three prevalence rates, 0.07%, 0.14% and 0.28%, the chances of a positive test successfully indicating the presence of the infection is 15%, 25% and 41%, respectively. That’s something school kids, parents and their teachers are just not being told. The Royal Statistical Society’s COVID-19 taskforce has also raised concerns over the risk of ‘positive’ tests when infection prevalence is low. Isn’t it odd that no one seems to be listening? We’d ask again: where is the cost/benefit analysis showing that this massive purchase using taxpayers money of 57 million lateral flow test kits was justified for schools? Spit or swab? Nose and throat swab testing can not only potentially harm the person being tested, it’s also downright unpleasant. Is there a better way of testing? Actually there is, but we’re not hearing much about it. It involves the plethora of saliva tests that appear to be as effective as the lateral flow tests — and far easier to administer. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a far higher number of saliva samples were positive for up to 10 days following diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to swab samples. Saliva tests are becoming increasingly available, but have yet to be utilized by governments. Here are some details: USA SalivaDirect — developed by Yale School of Public Health was approved for use by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in August of last year. Scientists at Washington University have announced the development of a saliva test they hope could be used at scale. DxTerity has added a saliva based SARS-CoV-2 test to its portfolio. UK Covguard saliva tests are available to UK citizens. Vatic Health is another UK based offering created by a team of scientists, engineers and designers. And if you’re looking for saliva tests that also fulfill ‘Fit to Fly’ requirements then take a look at Fitness Genes and Hydro-x . Australia A team at the University of Technology, Sydney has developed a very sensitive saliva test for SARS-CoV-2 antigens that can deliver results in under 15 minutes.

In a recent interview with New American journalist Veronika Kyrylenko, Dr. Ryan Cole talked of a “pattern” he has seen in recent months between vaccines and dramatically increased cases of cancer and is attempting to sound the alarm. According to the RAIR Foundation : Data from his vaccinated patients and data sent to him by oncologists show that the vaccines disrupt the immune system. Cole also said that the all-cause mortality rate is higher in vaccinated people. When the vaccine was rolled out, the pathologist began to see “this virus that causes this little bump in kids, starting to appear in adults.” In addition, he noticed that cancer rates among women were starting to rise. For example, the number of endometrial and cervical cancer cases was higher than usual. “It’s a pattern,” Cole told Kyrylenko. “People need to know that there are risks involved. The benefits have to be higher than the risks. “We know that these shots are not working – they are failed now. Now that Omicron is here, the shots have completely failed,” he continued. “The shot they still are telling people to get a booster [of] is a spike protein that is toxic to the human body. It causes the same disease as the virus and predisposes people to autoimmune attacks and potentially short-term cancer risks,” the pathologist added. It should be noted that Cole is a board-certified pathologist who was trained at the Mayo Clinic, as well as the CEO and Medical Director of Cole Diagnostics, one of the largest independent labs in the State of Idaho. But of course, after he began to speak out, he’s now being maligned and targeted by the deep state and others in bed with Big Pharma and profits, leading him to observe that “we have lost our collective medical minds for money.” Still, after Cole began to speak about the risks of the COVID vaccine, “numerous” oncologists began to contact him, reporting that they are “seeing the weirdest cancers, and cancers that we have been able to keep in check and treat, taking off like wildfire – going stage 2, stage 3, stage 4, just like that.” “That’s because of the immune dysregulation that these shots cause,” Cole said, noting further immune systems that become compromised are not able to keep the growth of cancerous cells in check. The RAIR Foundation notes further: In most countries, any measures to combat Covid other than the failed and dangerous “vaccination” are systematically suppressed. Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, monoclonal antibodies, quercetin, NAC, zinc, vitamins D3 and C are all are being condemned, ridiculed, and banned by the state. Doctors like Cole who prescribe Ivermectin or alternative treatments are fired, deemed medically and psychologically unfit, or persecuted. And yet increasingly, new research is proving that treatments other than vaccines are not just working to suppress COVID illnesses, they are saving lives — which is what the same leaders who are pushing nothing but vaccines and endless boosters claim they want to do. As for the vaccines, they appear to be responsible for the formation of ‘micro blood clots’ thanks to the formation of spike proteins on cells. “Doctors and researchers are now confirming that nearly all the negative side effects and deaths stemming from covid vaccines are the result of blood clots ,” Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, wrote this week. “Many of those clots are very small and unable to be easily detected with standard medical imaging equipment. These clots, called ‘micro blood clots,’ can cut off the blood supply to small regions of the brain, organs and tissues throughout the body,” he adds.

Sports The NCAA recognizes natural immunity. Here's what it means. The NCAA on Thursday released its new COVID-19 guidance for winter sports, and the guidance contains some important news. As ESPN reports , the NCAA's COVID-19 Medical Advisory Group updated its definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to account for various new vaccinations, boosters, and immunity factors. ""Fully vaccinated individuals now include those within two months of receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, five months of receiving the Pfizer vaccine series or six months of receiving the Moderna vaccine series;"" reports ESPN staff writer Jeff Borzello, ""and individuals who are beyond the aforementioned timeline and have received the booster vaccine."" But perhaps the biggest development came in the following line. ""Individuals within 90 days of a documented COVID-19 infection fall within the equivalent of 'fully vaccinated.'"" Natural Immunity Is Now Considered Fully Vaccinated by NCAA In many parts of the world, including the United States, vaccine passports are required for travel. Vaccine passports are morally dubious for several reasons, but they seem particularly unjust for people who've already had COVID-19, since they've already been exposed to the virus and have acquired natural immunity. Some evidence, such as a medical study out of Israel published in October, suggests that people with natural immunity actually have more protection from COVID-19 than vaccinated individuals. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Chief Medical Advisor to the President, was recently asked on CNN about the Israeli study — specifically if people naturally infected with COVID-19 had a lower risk of contracting the virus than those who received the vaccine. He declined to give a clear answer. ""I don't have a really firm answer for you on that,"" Fauci said . ""That's something that we're going to have to discuss regarding the durability of the response."" Harvard Medical School professor Martin Kulldorff disagrees. ""Based on the solid evidence from the Israeli study, the Covid recovered have stronger and longer-lasting immunity against Covid disease than the vaccinated,"" Kulldorff wrote . ""Hence, there is no reason to prevent them from activities that are permitted to the vaccinated."" 'No Federal Solution' Getting vaccinated after getting COVID-19 might provide additional protection. ""Recent research,"" the Mayo Clinic says , ""suggests that people who got COVID-19 in 2020 and then received mRNA vaccines produce very high levels of antibodies that are likely effective against current and, possibly, future variants. Some scientists call this hybrid immunity."" Kulldorff is right, however, that it is unnecessary and indeed discriminatory to treat people with natural immunity differently than those who've been vaccinated. (Vaccine passports themselves are morally dubious, as noted above, since they deprive individuals of fundamental freedoms .) Moreover, Kulldorff says the NCAA's decision to consider those who've had COVID ""fully vaccinated"" for just three months — a smaller window than those who've received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — is strange since evidence indicates that natural immunity offers stronger protections against COVID than the vaccines. ""It is good that the NCAA recognizes natural immunity for those who have recovered from Covid, but, since natural immunity is stronger and longer lasting than vaccine induced immunity, there are no public health reasons to only acknowledge it for three months after infection,"" Kulldorff, an epidemiologist and biostatistician who has studied infectious disease outbreaks for years, told me in an email. Still, while Dr. Fauci may not have made up his mind on natural immunity yet, it's clear that other organizations are reaching their own conclusions as the federal government's clumsy attempts to contain COVID-19 continue to fail. ""The omicron variant has presented another surge of cases across the country,"" NCAA chief medical officer Brian Hainline said. ""Given how the pandemic continues to evolve, it's important that staff on member campuses continue to work with their local and state health officials on protocols most suitable for their locations."" It's unclear precisely what Hainline meant with these comments, but his use of the terms ""local and state-health officials"" may reflect President Biden's recent admission that ""there's no federal solution"" to the pandemic. This would certainly be a step in the right direction. But the real epiphany will be when they realize the heavy hand of the state has only made the pandemic worse.

Para formar a mensagem “400 mil vidas”, de 14 metros de altura e 92 metros de comprimento, foram utilizadas 18 toneladas de mantimentos e produtos, que serão doados para comunidades e instituições que já vêm atendendo famílias em situação de vulnerabilidade na capital do Amazonas e seu entorno: CUFA Manaus, Parque das Tribos, Comunidade do Julião, Aldeia Beija-flor e Associação Omisma Watyamã. Diante da mais grave crise de saúde já enfrentada na história recente do país, a ação realizada hoje também tem como objetivo cobrar do poder público sua responsabilidade no combate à pandemia, com foco prioritário na adoção de medidas eficazes de proteção para toda a sociedade brasileira, com destaque para políticas públicas focadas nas classes mais vulneráveis e na redução das desigualdades, que têm se acentuado nos últimos meses. “Chegamos ao trágico número de 400 mil pessoas que perderam suas vidas por conta de um cenário que, em grande parte, poderia ter sido evitado. Vivemos hoje em um país onde falta respeito à população e onde milhões de brasileiras e brasileiros seguem abandonados à própria sorte – sem vacina, sem comida, sem emprego”, afirma Tica Minami, Diretora de Programas do Greenpeace Brasil. “Desde o início da pandemia, o governo federal vem agindo de forma irresponsável para lidar com a doença e proteger a população, provocando danos profundos a milhares de famílias e prejuízos econômicos para o país. Trata-se de um cenário que poderia ter sido evitado se a pandemia tivesse sido tratada com seriedade e respeito pela ciência”, complementa. A pandemia expôs e agravou as desigualdades sociais que assolam o Brasil: o desemprego disparou e já são 14,3 milhões de pessoas à procura de trabalho e cerca de 19 milhões de pessoas – 9% da população brasileira – sem comida na mesa nem auxílio de políticas sociais efetivas para garantir seus direitos básicos. Não bastasse a renda minguar, os preços dos alimentos, combustíveis, energia e outros itens essenciais só subiram nos últimos meses. Além disso, o país hesita em dar uma resposta firme e eficiente contra a Covid-19. A campanha de vacinação no Brasil, que já chegou a imunizar mais de 18 milhões de crianças em um só dia em campanhas anteriores, hoje tropeça na falta de doses em decorrência da total falta de planejamento. Enquanto milhões de pessoas sofrem com incertezas, o presidente Jair Bolsonaro segue dando declarações levianas, minimizando a gravidade da doença, estimulando medidas ineficazes, gerando aglomerações e promovendo ataques constantes à democracia. O que pedimos: Medidas de proteção – que o poder público siga as recomendações dos especialistas e estabeleça medidas de isolamento social garantidas por meio de um lockdown neste momento crítico e desenvolva melhor capacidade de rastreamento e monitoramento dos casos, além de testagem para controle de disseminação do vírus, com a compra e distribuição de testes antigênicos pelo Estado; Apoio econômico à população carente – que o Estado permita que as pessoas fiquem em casa, com a garantia de um auxílio emergencial, e apoie a manutenção dos pequenos negócios para preservar os postos de trabalho, especialmente entre os mais pobres, que também são mais vulneráveis à doença e às várias formas de violência que se acentuam neste momento; Fortalecimento do SUS – que o governo federal garanta os recursos financeiros e o abastecimento de insumos (como medicamentos, equipamentos e oxigênio) para os entes federativos. E assegure que o acesso às vacinas seja feito apenas pelo Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS), e não pelo setor privado, o que privilegiaria apenas aqueles que podem pagar e não protege os mais vulneráveis; Medidas que ofereçam riscos à sociedade e ao meio ambiente não sejam estabelecidas pelo poder público e nem colocadas em discussão na pandemia – Em relação à natureza e direitos sociais, o poder público, seja Executivo, Legislativo ou Judiciário, tem o dever de garantir que os interesses particulares que ameacem a proteção ambiental e os direitos não prevaleçam em meio ao combate à pandemia. Ou seja, devem priorizar as pautas que tratam do enfrentamento da pandemia, tanto sanitárias quanto sociais. Em um momento em que vidas são perdidas e pessoas estão passando fome e perdendo sua fonte de renda, é inaceitável que o poder público aproveite esta tragédia nacional para continuar “passando a boiada” na arena ambiental e de direitos – como os projetos de lei da grilagem, do licenciamento ambiental e de exploração em terras indígenas, além de cortes no orçamento em áreas sensíveis como educação e programas sociais. Solidariedade Enquanto o poder público falha em assumir sua responsabilidade e liderar uma resposta firme e adequada à crise da Covid-19, a sociedade civil organizada não tem poupado esforços em agir de maneira rápida e eficaz para minimizar os danos da pandemia. A crise sanitária, econômica e social que o país vive só pode ser enfrentada com união e solidariedade, e não com divisão e o medo. “A escolha jamais deveria ser entre comer ou ter saúde, entre se proteger ou trabalhar. Esse é um falso dilema, criado para transferir a responsabilidade, que é do poder público, para os indíviduos”, afirma Tica. Da mesma forma, não existe escolha ou dilema entre um meio ambiente equilibrado e uma população saudável e próspera, pois um é condição para o outro. Ao longo do último ano, o Greenpeace Brasil realizou o projeto Asas da Emergência, que levou alimentos e materiais de saúde para diversas comunidades na Amazônia. Por meio desta iniciativa foram doadas mais de 100 toneladas de insumos para cerca de 70 povos indígenas em cinco estados amazônicos – Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima e Acre. Também foi instalada uma usina de oxigênio na cidade de São Gabriel da Cachoeira, no Amazonas, onde vivem 23 povos indígenas e 750 comunidades. A usina atenderá não só esse município, mas também Barcelos e Santa Isabel do Rio Negro – os três juntos, totalizam quase 100 mil habitantes. Além disso, distribuímos em 2020 mais de 4.400 marmitas em São Paulo (SP) e no Rio de Janeiro (RJ) com o objetivo de auxiliar famílias carentes. Atualmente, estamos trabalhando com parceiros para levar cestas agroecológicas a quem mais precisa. Já foram distribuídas mais de três toneladas desses alimentos para comunidades em Fortaleza (CE), Maceió (AL), Recife (PE) e Manaus (AM). O governo federal precisa assumir sua responsabilidade e investir na construção e adoção de políticas públicas estruturantes e inclusivas. O Brasil e a sociedade brasileira precisam e merecem mais. Uma ação firme é mais urgente do que nunca, não se pode esperar. É uma decisão política e, como tal, uma questão de prioridade: a de garantir a vida de todas as pessoas e a proteção da nossa casa comum.

Jeff Bezos worked in Wall Street before he reinvented himself and started Amazon. Sara Blakely sold office supplies before she started Spanx. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was a WWE wrestler before he became a successful actor and filmmaker. Arnold Schwarzenegger went from a bodybuilder, to an actor to a Governor. McDonald’s founder Ray Croc was a milkshake-device salesman before starting the McDonalds franchise in his 50’s. How does one reinvent themselves? What hurdles have to be overcome to take life in a new direction? How do you overcome those challenges? How do you ignore the naysayers? How do you push through the paralyzing fear? In this series called “ Second Chapters; How I Reinvented Myself In The Second Chapter Of My Life “ we are interviewing successful people who reinvented themselves in a second chapter in life, to share their story and help empower others. As a part of this interview series, I had the pleasure of interviewing Maya McNulty. Maya McNulty is the founder of Covid Wellness, LLC. She is a three times Best -Selling Author, and Podcaster. She has worked with thousands of people for more than two decades creating opportunities for entrepreneurs as one of America’s most respected business branding strategists, marketer and speaker. Maya a young female battled Coronavirus March 2020, hospitalized for 69 days, in a 30 day medically-induced coma and ventilator for six weeks. Maya, a long hauler, has had to re-learn how to walk, talk and eat again. She lost her memory, hair, voice and is still recovering steadily. After 18 months of therapy, Maya started Covid Wellness Clinic Online Program to heal long haulers from the comfort of their home. She also started Covid Wellness Clinic on Facebook. The group helps to support Covid-19 survivors and their families with recovery support and guidance. Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we start, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your childhood backstory? I was born in Guyana, South America. My parents and my two brothers and I came to America in 1979. I was six years old. I can best remember flying on PanAm Airlines. It was my first plane ride experience. We landed in New York City, at JFK airport with our suitcases and a dream for a better life. In 1983 my family and I became American citizens. My mom worked in a factory and my dad as an Orthopedic Tech. My parents taught my brothers and I about hard work, discipline, integrity and to show up! As a kid, I was always into trouble with my mouth. My high school guidance counselor suggested I go into law. I always argued to find solutions even at a young age. It’s no wonder I am an advocate for long hauler Covid families and survivors of Covid-19. Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life? “I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost 300 games. 26 times, I was trusted to take the game shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over again in my life. And that is why I Succeed.” — Michal Jordan In a nut shell don’t give up! You are stronger than you think! This was the hardest fight of my life. I thought if just pushed through every day and gave 1% more, by the end of the year my health and mental attitude would improve by 365%. You have been blessed with much success. In your opinion, what are the top three qualities that you possess that have helped you accomplish so much? If you can, please share a story or example for each. Perseverance, will-power and positive mental attitude is what saved me. I can best remember being hoyer lifted out of my hospital bed on to a wheel chair for physical therapy. There were many times I wanted to throw the towel in. My body suffered from terrible neuropathy and atrophy while coming out of the coma. My family was counting on me to fight this beast and not lose hope! Let’s now shift to the main part of our discussion about ‘Second Chapters’. Can you tell our readers about your career experience before your Second Chapter? I was introduced to entrepreneurship in eighth grade when our class had an end-of-year project requirement to raise money for our “moving up” dance. Our class created a carnival and sold popcorn, cotton candy, balloons and handmade crafts. We even had the dreaded-by-parents- universally, win-a-goldfish game. This experience taught me about teamwork. I grew up in Schenectady, NY, and studied fashion in high school through the Vo-tech program at Linton High School where I created my first design portfolio. I had a burning desire to change the fashion industry with sustainable and recycled clothes. In 1991, I studied Fashion Merchandising and Design at Bay State College in Boston, Mass. In 1993, I was privileged to continue my studies of fashion and design in London and Paris. I also had a fashion designer mentor in the North End of Boston, Denise Hajjar. After graduating from college, I returned to Upstate, NY, and searched for a real “job” to repay college loans. I worked in insurance for about 18 months and later got fired. After being fired, I desperately tried to find a job in fashion design. With no luck, I was employed on unemployment. I took an SBA class through Empire Development, joined SCORE and found a mentor. I opened my first business Vintage Boutique in Scotia, NY. The fashion lines included recycled jeans and repurposed clothes. We also sold jewelry and a mix of new fashions. The dress shop changed the name from Vintage Boutique to Village Boutique after three months of clients and market not wanting recycled or used clothing. I learned a lot about marketing, customer service and running a business through hands-on experience. How do you reinvent yourself in your second chapter? I have a strong purpose, a burning desire and persistence. I realize that even small steps matter, and if you’re changing one life for the better you’ve accomplished your goal. One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat. To avoid failing, many history makers have reinvented themselves and their business model to thrive in a global economy. Henry Ford designed a high-end car his employees couldn’t afford. As a result, the company morale plummeted until he offered his employees a chance to afford the car at cost. As a result, sales increased as did company morale. Kenneth Cole certainly reinvented himself in a big way and has landed his shoes in practically every woman’s closet! He founded his American fashion house in 1982. He wanted to preview his line of shoes at the New York Shoe Expo at the New York Hilton but couldn’t afford the purchase of a hotel room so inquired about parking a trailer two blocks from the Hilton Hotel. Upon discovering that permits for trailers were only granted to utility and production companies, Cole changed the name of his company from Kenneth Cole Incorporated to Kenneth Cole Productions and applied for a permit to film the full-length film, “The Birth of a Shoe Company.” In two and a half days, Kenneth Cole Productions sold forty thousand pairs of shoes, while chronicling the beginning of the company on film. Talk about resourcefulness! Another person who has completely reinvented herself is Barbara Ann Corcoran, an American businesswoman, investor, speaker, consultant, syndicated columnist, author and television personality on Shark Tank. She founded The Corcoran Group, a real estate brokerage in New York City, which she then sold to NRT for 66 million dollars in 2001 and shortly thereafter exited the company. One of her famous quotes is, “My best success came on the heels of failure.” Oprah Winfrey was told she would never make it as a daytime talk show host. What I’m saying is that as Americans, we have the capacity to make decisions ourselves and to dream big and be bigger than ourselves. My number one advice to those with a desire to reinvent one’s self would be to find a mentor. Don’t hire a mentor. Mentors are everywhere if you simply ask. I’m honored to have a leadership mentor, a product design mentor, an SEO mentor, a branding mentor, a course creation mentor and a medical mentor because I’m raising better Covid-19 awareness. All of my mentors operate multi-million-dollar businesses. They are free! I don’t pay them a dime. I just asked, “Would you be my mentor?” We have launched Covid Wellness Clinic online program. Covid Wellness, LLC is dedicated to the support and education of families and individuals living with serious and debilitating long covid. These are the Covid- 19 long haulers. Covid Wellness Clinic advocates for better services in the health system of care, strives to educate the public about the effects of long haulers, to eradicate the stigma and supports Covid- 19 research and science. With Covid Wellness LLC, I’m working with HR departments so they can share it with people at no cost or low cost. This way, we are able to alleviate the financial burden I felt, and others are feeling. Our program will help people understand where to start. This way there is hope. I feel that the reason I survived is so I can give people hope, and if I can make someone’s life better and more worth living, I am answering the code like the doctors did for me. Over 675,000 people have died in the U.S.A., and I am incredibly lucky that I survived. In that surviving, I ask myself what I can do to improve the life that I have? Medicine is a catastrophic failure when it comes to that, and the cost is unbearable to family’s which is causing a mental health problem. They are making it so difficult some people are committing suicide. By putting a bandaid on one problem you are opening another can of worms. We need to provide better health insurance, because, quite simply, people don’t know what they don’t know. Can you tell us about the specific trigger that made you decide that you were going to “take the plunge” and make your huge transition? When I woke up in the ICU bed after a month on the ventilator, 69 days in the hospital, ten months of physcial therapy, I hadn’t fully healed as projected by doctors and therapists. I needed more care and because Covid wasn’t text book, I created one! With Covid Wellness Clinic Online Program, The aftermath of Covid-19 is sky rocking with no end in sight! I’m working with HR departments so they can share it with employees at no cost or low cost. This way, we are able to alleviate the financial burden I felt, and others are feeling. Our program will help people understand where to start. This way there is hope. I feel that the reason I survived is so I can give people hope, and if I can make someone’s life better and more worth living, I am answering the code like the doctors did for me. What did you do to discover that you had a new skillset inside of you that you haven’t been maximizing? How did you find that and how did you ultimately overcome the barriers to help manifest those powers? I realized that Covid-19 didn’t happen to me, but for me. Through the power of prayer, mental strength and fight for survival evoked an even stronger willpower to live a life of purpose and make a stronger impact with my second chance at life. The world is less because of those who lost their lives to Covid-19. Those of us given a second chance have become a vessel for change and impact post Covid-19. How are things going with this new initiative? We would love to hear some specific examples or stories. After 18 months of therapy, Covid Wellness Online Program has created a network of over 1400 members healing from the comfort of their home.

Learn More: www.covidwellnessclinic.com Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that? My husband has been my cheerleader from day one. He has literally carried me through my entire Covid experience. And I mean literally. He carried me on his back to the car to drive me to the hospital, when we didn’t even know what Covid was! I was exposed to it at my gym, and when I began feeling bad, it came on quickly. I am now dealing with long hauler Covid, and each day is a struggle. With my husband and family behind me, I find the strength to help others. Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you started in this new direction? Thankfully, on July 26, 2021, the Biden/ Harris administration passed the bill recognizing long Covid in the Americans with Disabilities Act. That’s something I played a small part in. I’m really proud of and something naysayers couldn’t understand. Did you ever struggle with believing in yourself? If so, how did you overcome that limiting belief about yourself? Can you share a story or example? What hurdles have to be overcome to take life in a new direction? I’m not perfect and valuing self worth is something most struggle with. I’ve often challenged my positive mindset and mental attitude with continuing education and learning. My own mental challenges, I have to persevere and push through it. I don’t believe you need to be in the hospital to start a new direction, that is just what happened to me. I can best remember lifeless in my hospital bed at Sunnyview Rehabilitation Center thinking, how can I make my Covid experience help others? Barely being able to hold my cellphone, I reached out on Facebook messenger and asked for help on how to get more help for Covid long haulers. Many simply sent me a thumbs-up and were dismissive. I soon realized this was a new disease and a direction had not been laid out yet. In my own work I usually encourage my clients to ask for support before they embark on something new. How did you create your support system before you moved to your new chapter? Covid-19 blindsided the masses. Sometimes we have no choice but to go all in and make a change for humanity with humility. My number one advice to those with a desire to reinvent themselves would be to find a mentor. Don’t hire a mentor. Mentors are everywhere if you simply ask. I’m honored to have a leadership mentor, a product design mentor, an SEO mentor, a branding mentor, a course creation mentor and a medical mentor because I’m raising better Covid-19 awareness. All of my mentors operate multi-million-dollar businesses. They are free! I don’t pay them a dime. I just asked, “Would you be my mentor?” Starting a new chapter usually means getting out of your comfort zone, how did you do that? Can you share a story or example of that? Many entrepreneurs move out of this invisible line called a comfort zone when their ready to grow mentally, emotionally and financially. They keep their circle tight when creating new verticals. Naysayers, haven’t walked in my shoes, so how could they possibly know what I am going through? One of the things I’ve done is block them out mentally because there are a lot of people with opposite opinions not backed by fact, and compliance. One of the ways I do this is to either tune them out gently or delete. They are simply expressing their opinions, and so am I. The difference is I back up what I say with facts. What are your “5 things I wish someone told me before I started leading my organization” and why? Please share a story or example for each. Don’t ever let anyone dim your flame. Have confidence in yourself. When someone attacks you, let it roll off. I have done that with my initiative and it has helped me move forward. Be yourself. Don’t stop. It’s ok to say you’re tired. Keep learning. You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? I would like to erase the stigma surrounding Covid long haulers. If more doctors, insurance companies and healthcare workers were educated about this disease, lives would be forever changed for the better.This is the reason we have launched Covid Wellness Clinic, LLC online. Covid Wellness is dedicated to the support and education of families and individuals living with serious and debilitating long covid. These are the Covid 19 long haulers.

Recor’s business leverages the use of AI tracking by offering new revenue streams to cash-strapped states. ⁃ TN Editor"," Technocrats invent because they can, especially when it comes to surveillance and monitoring. Recor’s business leverages the use of AI tracking by offering new revenue streams to cash-strapped states. ⁃ TN Editor Cash-strapped states are using COVID as an excuse to create AI-driven vehicle recognition or license plate reader surveillance programs. As Rekor System s president and CEO Robert Berman proudly boasts, “because our technology works so well for vehicle recognition, we do more, we identify the vehicle’s make, model, color, body type, bumper stickers or window decals, rust, dents and other things like speed of travel and vehicle direction.” (approximately 2.40 of the video.) Berman revealed that fast-food restaurants are using Rekor’s vehicle surveillance program “because it helps the folks who are making the food to do it more efficiently” claiming that it helps companies like Starbucks, ID customers who order the same thing everyday. Berman also admitted that Rekor’s vehicle surveillance program is tied to smart city surveillance, saying “this is where things are headed, this is where thing are going to converge.” Rekor bills itself as an AI-driven vehicle recognition company, but all it really is; is a AI-driven license plate reader company that “operates in over 500 regions worldwide.” A recent article in One Zero , revealed that Oklahoma is using COVID as an excuse to secretly create a statewide mass vehicle surveillance program using Rekor to help raise much-needed funds. “Oklahoma, which has seen its tax revenue plummet along s ide falling oil prices, announced a statewide rollout of Rekor One in November to track uninsured motorists.” From airports to schools and now vehicles, is there no end to using COVID to increase public surveillance? A Rekor press release from November 2020 reveals just how big their vehicle surveillance program is. “Use of the Rekor One platform by Oklahoma’s Uninsured Vehicle Enforcement Diversion Program (UVED) Program furthers the state’s mission to decrease the number of uninsured motorists on the road and keep matters out of the court system. The platform allows for real-time detection of non-compliant vehicles and instant data consolidation into a regularly updating insurance database connected to the state’s enforcement programs. Additionally, Rekor’s AI-driven technology identifies a vehicle’s make, model and color—providing additional validation for confirming vehicle identification.” Rekor and the Oklahoma District Attorneys Council claim the program is an improvement over being stopped and fined by law enforcement. “Instead of receiving a criminal court summons and a $250 fine, uninsured motorists captured by Rekor’s cameras, which are mounted on utility poles and mobile trailers, are sent a violation notice to their home, hit with a $174 citation, and must enroll in an insurance policy through Rekor’s insurance portal.” So instead of being stopped and fined by public officials, Oklahoma drivers should accept a statewide vehicle surveillance program that is designed to get more money out of people by mailing fines to their homes and forcing them to use Rekor’s insurance? As One Zero points out, if people cannot afford to pay their corporate overlords they could be prosecuted. If an individual can’t pay, however, they may face prosecution. “Prosecutorial discretion attends to those who demonstrate acute financial distress,” UVED Program Director/Prosecutor Amanda Arnall Couch said in an email. “The purpose of this program is to help the most vulnerable.” The Tea Party rebellion started on a lot less than what states like Oklahoma are doing. Mass surveillance masquerading as public safety leading to corporate fines and prosecution, because someone could not afford to pay their automobile insurance during a pandemic, seems like a stretch even for the Police State. Rekor wants their corporate/law enforcement vehicle surveillance program to spread across the country. “It’s common business practice that you want to expand your success. We know we are successful in the state of Oklahoma and other states have taken notice,” Rekor Executive Vice President Charles Deglimini said. Cash-strapped governments are turning to tech that converts cameras into automated license plate readers to ID, track and penalize drivers for all sorts of offenses. States like Louisiana , Nevada , and Florida have been tracking uninsured motorists with ALPRs, but Oklahoma is the first to implement a statewide vehicle surveillance program. “This year, Texas , Tennessee , and Florida introduced legislation that would require statewide ALPR-assisted insurance enforcement programs. In February, Rekor announced a pilot program at three national parks in North Dakota. A recent New York state bill would prohibit individuals and businesses from using ALPR data, but expands state power by outlining ALPR surveillance as a viable tool for identifying parking and traffic violations, violations of registration requirements, and violations of inspection requirements.” Rekor uses video doorbells to create neighborhood vehicle surveillance networks As I wrote about last year, Rekor is using video doorbells like Ring to create a 68 million neighborhood vehicle surveillance network . “Rekor is going to great lengths to turn smart homes into neighborhood vehicle surveillance networks. To entice suburban residents, it’s offering a steep price drop — from the $50 a month it charges businesses and law enforcement agencies to $5 a month, less than the price of a newspaper subscription. Rekor also allows your neighbor to identify a limited number of vehicles for $99, $395 or $1995 a month.” And that’s not all, Rekor also tracks, ID’s and fines vehicles in parking lots and permit parking only spots . One thing is clear, government officials are using COVID as an excuse to create mass surveillance programs run by private corporations. “What you seem to have here is a mass surveillance program being created to satisfy the insurance industry, and to potentially generate money for the government” Dave Maas, director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation warned. The mass media and government officials want everyone to look the other way as they use COVID as an excuse to let corporations profit from all manners of public surveillance.

Un philosophe ne naît pas et ne se forme pas dans une tour d'ivoire, mais au milieu de ses concitoyens et en interaction avec eux ; son savoir, sa réflexion, ne se développent pas dans les nuées, mais dans le monde des hommes, et doivent servir à en rendre compte et mieux le comprendre. Inversement, un philosophe n'est pas un mage, un prophète, qui définit le bien et dit le droit à partir de choix subjectifs. Si Agamben a pris partie dans l'affaire du Covid,c'est bien en tant que philosophe, à partir des concepts qu'il a élaborés au cours de ses analyses, et en premier lieu du concept de « vie nue ». Au commencement était Foucault et son concept de « biopouvoir » : à partir du XVIIIe siècle, l'évolution politique ne va pas (contrairement à ce que proclament les illuminés des Lumières) vers plus de liberté, mais au contraire vers le totalitarisme ; armé de nouvelles connaissances et techniques, le pouvoir peut, non seulement punir en cas de transgression (fonctionnement rudimentaire), mais régir la vie entière de tous les sujets, par un empilement, non pas de lois, mais de simples directives administratives qui encadrent la moindre de nos activités (Tocqueville qui avait déjà, certes de façon moins systématique, fait ce constat, parlait, non de biopouvoir, mais de « monstre doux »). Mais l'analyse foucaldienne mettait en cause uniquement le pouvoir de l'État, et ses disciples se retrouvent aujourd'hui essentiellement dans le camp libéral, et suivent le courant politiquement correct : aucune voix ne s'élève parmi eux pour défendre nos libertés concrètes. Agamben, lui, analyse le pouvoir réel, qui est celui du néo-libéralisme, et fait entendre sa protestation contre un biopouvoir (pouvoir sur la vie) qui n'est plus qu'un thanatopouvoir (pouvoir de mort) : l'objectif de « faire vivre », justification de toute l'entreprise totalitaire, n'est plus que le masque du « faire mourir » (on ne peut éviter de penser au pouvoir nazi, passé de l' « espace vital » - faire vivre les Allemands - aux camps de concentration et à l'agression contre l'URSS - faire mourir les non-aryens). Le pouvoir médical joue ici un rôle de premier plan. Certes, la médecine était déjà, à la fin du XVIIIe siècle, un bras armé du pouvoir : elle permet, de façon économique (sans « faire descendre les chars dans la rue »), de discipliner la population par la médicalisation de la vie, de la naissance à la mort. Mais ce qui est inédit, dans la crise du Covid, c'est qu'elle a exercé son office au moyen du refus de soigner (imposé par le Pouvoir politique), organisant ainsi la mortalité attribuée au Covid. Le Pouvoir a donc pu opérer en boucle, et de façon absolue : s'appuyant sur le chiffre de morts ainsi obtenu, il a propagé de façon obsessionnelle la peur de mourir, qui a fait accepter toutes les mesures liberticides . Le parallèle s'impose avec la mafia, qui extorque de l'argent en imposant sa protection contre des exactions qu'elle commet elle-même. La politique, au sens de discussions, d'échanges d'idées sur la meilleure façon de résoudre les problèmes qui se posent à une communauté, a ainsi disparu, pour laisser place à une seule question : comment éviter de mourir ? Vie sociale, affective, culturelle, tout ce qui fait le « bios », a disparu devant l'impératif de la "" zoè"", la vie brute, biologique, la « vie nue » d'Agamben. Or, dans l'opuscule d'Agamben « La guerre civile », publié en 2015, à partir de deux séminaires tenus en 2001, on trouve une allégorie, ou une prémonition exacte de la situation actuelle. Léviathan de Hobbes Dans la deuxième partie du livre, Agamben s'intéresse au Léviathan de Hobbes à partir de son célèbre frontispice de 1651, qui représente un roi tenant d'une main une épée, et de l'autre une crosse d'évêque, symboles des pouvoirs temporel et spirituel, se dressant au-dessus d'un paysage fait de campagnes entourant une grande ville. Agamben s'étonne que cette ville (tout comme les campagnes) soit vide d'habitants. Mais, en y regardant de plus près, on remarque que, dans la zone droite de la ville (à gauche pour le lecteur), c'est-à-dire dans la zone du pouvoir politique, il y a des gardes armés, et dans la zone gauche, celle du pouvoir religieux, on voit, près de la cathédrale, deux figures, qu'il faut examiner à la loupe pour se rendre compte qu'il s'agit de deux « médecins de la peste », reconnaissables à leur masque à long bec. (On pourrait d'ailleurs s'étonner que les médecins, qui soignent le corps, apparaissent du côté du pouvoir religieux : remarquable anticipation de notre époque, où la survie du corps a remplacé la survie de l'âme, et la figure du médecin supplanté celle du prêtre). Le peuple est donc absent, représenté seulement par les forces qui assurent sa soumission au Pouvoir. Comment ne pas penser aux deux cycles que nous avons connus récemment ? D'abord, en 2018-19, la révolte des Gilets Jaunes, matée par la police, armée, au lieu de mousquetons, de LBD éborgneurs et arracheurs de mains ; puis, en 2020-21, la terreur covidienne, administrée par les médias et les médecins de plateau. Ces derniers ont remplacé les « généraux de plateau » de la Guerre du Golfe - est-ce un progrès ? En 2003, il avait fallu la guerre pour imposer une information totalitaire où tous les médias, toutes les chaînes confondus faisaient entendre le même son de cloche ; aujourd'hui, la censure peut s'imposer sans problème même en temps de paix. Passer des généraux de plateau aux médecins de plateau est donc au contraire une véritable escalade dans le totalitarisme. Voilà donc notre « paysage après la bataille » : un régime d'où la politique et les citoyens ont disparu ; on n'a plus, selon le terme d'Agamben, qu'une « multitude dissoute », des masses atomisées, inorganisées (les partis politiques ne les représentent plus), invisibles, dont il ne reste que les masques (comme, du chat du Cheshire , il ne restait que le sourire, ou plutôt le rictus). Seules les forces de police peuvent se déplacer librement, seuls ont droit à la parole les médecins de plateau. La démocratie résiduelle du Covid n'est donc plus constituée que des deux types de chiens de garde qui surveillent le troupeau, réduit à n'être qu'objet de répression ou objet de soins (ou de refus de soins). Notre régime réalise ainsi cette adémie (absence de peuple) figurée par le frontispice du Léviathan. Cette situation n'est du reste pas vraiment pathologique, mais dans la logique de la démocratie bourgeoise : le peuple ne peut agir que par l'intermédiaire de ses représentants, et, sitôt ceux-ci élus, il disparaît comme sujet et n'a plus qu'à obéir. Mais nous sommes arrivés au bout de cette logique : le peuple, qui n'a pas de vrai statut légal, n'est même plus qualifié pour élire ses représentants, qui sont en fait cooptés : l'Assemblée dite Nationale ne représente plus rien, et l'élection présidentielle n'est qu'un théâtre de marionnettes dont les médias tirent les ficelles pour distraire les malades potentiels que nous sommes. Lars von Trier s'était montré prophète lorsqu'en 1994 il avait fait de son Grand Hôpital, appelé le Royaume, l'allégorie du pays tout entier, ou plutôt de l'Europe. Il sera intéressant de voir ce que la troisième saison de la série, qui doit sortir en 2022, nous réserve.",1,162

The latest release of VAERS data included descriptions of 438,441 adverse event reports following COVID-19 vaccinations, including 9,048 deaths that occurred after adults and children 12 years of age and older received experimental COVID-19 vaccines developed and manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna/NIAID, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen that are being distributed under a special Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pending licensure of the vaccines.","Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released data containing reports of health problems, including deaths, following receipt of federally recommended vaccines that have been filed with the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). 1 2 The latest release of VAERS data included descriptions of 438,441 adverse event reports following COVID-19 vaccinations, including 9,048 deaths 3 that occurred after adults and children 12 years of age and older received experimental COVID-19 vaccines developed and manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna/NIAID, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen that are being distributed under a special Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 4 5 pending licensure of the vaccines. There have been more deaths reported to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccinations than for any other federally recommended vaccine since VAERS became operational in 1990. 6 When deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines that occurred outside the United States are eliminated from the 9,048 total deaths reported to VAERS, the CDC reports there are just under 6,000 deaths following COVID-19 vaccinations administered in the U.S. that have been reported to the vaccine safety monitoring system. On July 7, 2021, the CDC stated on its website: 7 Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare . More than 331 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through July 6, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 5,946 reports of death (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. The CDC denies there is a link between death and COVID-19 vaccines, except a potential causal relationship between the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) that involves blood clots and low platelets that can cause death. 8 VAERS is a centralized vaccine reaction reporting system that was among the safety provisions secured by parents of DPT vaccine injured children in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, an historic law in which Congress for the first time acknowledged that vaccine injuries and deaths are real and that vaccine safety should be made a national priority to protect the health of children. 9 Under the 1986 Act, doctors and other medical workers administering federally recommended for children, which includes recommended vaccines that are also given to adults, are required to report adverse events following vaccination to VAERS, 10 11 but there is no legal sanction for failing to report. Vaccine adverse event reports can also be filed by those who have received the vaccines, a parent or guardian of a minor child, or a family member. 12 More Adverse Events Reported Following COVID-19 Vaccinations Than For Any Other Vaccine Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna/NIAID COVID-19 were granted an EUA to distribute their mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020 13 14 and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen were granted an EUA to distribute their adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021. 15 Since then, the COVID-19 vaccine has become associated with the highest number of adverse events reported to VAERS since it began operating in 1990, with influenza vaccine generating the second highest number of adverse event reports (190,307) to VAERS. Pertussis-containing vaccines have generated 170,372 adverse event reports and hepatitis B containing vaccines have generated 95,533 adverse event reports to VAERS. 16 Compared to the number of adverse event reports filed in VAERS for other federally recommended vaccines, there have been more deaths reported following receipt of COVID-19 vaccines than for any other vaccine since VAERS became operational in 1990. For example, out of a total of 17,875 deaths following vaccination reported to VAERS since 1990, there have been 3,199 reported deaths associated with pertussis containing vaccines; 2,789 reported deaths associated with haemophilus influenza B (Hib) containing vaccines; 2,235 reported deaths associated with hepatitis B containing vaccines, and 1,947 reported deaths associated with influenza vaccines. 17 According to a 2011 study funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), less than one percent of vaccine adverse events are reported to the government. That study concluded: 18 Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported. Although 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of “problem” drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. VAERS Accepts Reports from Vaccine Providers and the Public The National Vaccine Information Center, a charitable non-profit organization founded by parents of DPT vaccine injured children in 1982 to prevent vaccine injuries and deaths through public education, sponsors MedAlerts , which is a user-friendly search engine of vaccine adverse event data reported to VAERS. Before conducting a search, MedAlerts advises users to read the following CDC disclaimer: 19 VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to the system. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. In large part, reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. In describing VAERS, the CDC states that, “about 85 to 90 percent of the reports describe mild side effects such as fever, arm soreness, and crying or mild irritability. The remaining reports are classified as serious, which means that the adverse event resulted in permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or death.” 20 Make a vaccine adverse event report to VAERS here . Mainstream Media Attacking VAERS As the numbers of health problems following COVID-19 vaccinations, including deaths, continue to generate record breaking numbers of adverse event reports to VAERS, mainstream media outlets are publishing articles that attack the integrity of VAERS and question whether non-medical professionals should be allowed to report to or have access to information in the publicly accessible vaccine safety monitoring system. 21 22 One vaccine developer and pro-vaccination proponent quoted in Politifact said, “it’s a noisy system that frankly is more frightening than helpful,” suggesting that VAERS data should be hidden from the public so it can only be analyzed by government health officials. 23 However, in an article published in Newsweek , a University of Pennsylvania professor defended the transparency of VAERS, offering the perspective that a transparent system that has the potential to be misused is better than leaving people in the dark: 24 “With public access, there’s going to be misinterpretation of the data there,” she said. “But without public access, I think it’s worse. Because then you just have people imagining what’s there. And that can really be worse.” If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here .

In a formal notice, Murthy requested major tech platforms submit information about the prevalence and scale of COVID-19 misinformation on their sites, from social networks, search engines, crowdsourced platforms, e-commerce platforms and instant messaging systems. Misinformation about vaccinations took center stage earlier this year when Neil Young said he would pull his music off the music platform Spotify in protest over podcast host Joe Rogan , who had interviewed guests questioning the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. States Launch Probe Into TikTok’s Effect on Kids’ Health Associated Press reported : State attorneys general have launched a nationwide investigation into TikTok and its possible harmful effects on young users’ mental health , widening government scrutiny of the wildly popular video platform. The investigation was announced Wednesday by a number of states led by California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee and Vermont. U.S. lawmakers and federal regulators have criticized TikTok, citing practices and computer-driven promotion of content they say can endanger the physical and mental health of young users. The platform has an estimated 1 billion monthly users and is especially popular with teens and younger children. CA Legislators Propose New Slate of COVID Vaccine Laws Patch reported : Gov. Gavin Newsom is easing mask restrictions and declaring that the pandemic is moving into a less critical phase. Yet an aggressive slate of COVID-19 -related bills — to mandate vaccines for children and workers, to allow 12 to 17 year-olds to get the vaccine without parental consent and more — remain in play under the Capitol dome. The vaccine working group of Democratic legislators behind the proposals say their aim is to increase vaccination rates across all age groups, improve the state vaccine registration database and crack down on misinformation about the virus and the vaccine. Taken together, the adoption of these bills would make California an outlier among states — and give it the country’s strictest COVID-19 regulations. In Symbolic Vote, Senate Rejects Vaccine Mandate for Health Workers The New York Times reported : The Senate voted on Wednesday to roll back President Biden ’s vaccine mandate for healthcare workers at federally funded facilities, in a symbolic move orchestrated by Republicans who are pushing to weaponize pandemic precautions against Democrats in this year’s midterm congressional elections. In a vote forced by Republicans, the measure passed 49 to 44 along party lines, after 6 Democratic absences left the majority party short of the votes needed to defeat it. The measure is all but certain to die in the Democratic-controlled House; even if it cleared that chamber, the White House said on Wednesday that Mr. Biden would veto it . “This vaccine mandate is not about public health or science,” Senator Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican who is a physician, said in a speech on the Senate floor, a stethoscope draped around his neck. “The Biden administration’s mandate is about fulfilling their desire to control every aspect of our lives. And it’s a slap in the face to the hard-working men and women who never took a day off in the frontline fight of the COVID-19 battle.” Pre-Order Now! “The Real RFK Jr: Trials of a Truth Warrior” With Carnival Over, New Orleans Dropping COVID Mandates The Hill reported : New Orleans will drop multiple COVID-19 restrictions as Carnival season, which attracts revelers from around the country, comes to an end. In a statement on Wednesday, the New Orleans Health Department said the city’s indoor mask mandate will be lifted on Thursday, and it will also lift its vaccine mandate for city venues later this month. Health Department Director Dr. Jennifer Avegno noted that the city’s proof of vaccination requirement will end on Mar. 21 if the city’s hospitalizations rates remain stable. ‘Freedom Convoy’ Spinoff Headed to DC Region Arrives This Weekend. Here’s What to Know. The Washington Post reported : The U.S. protesters inspired by the self-styled “ Freedom Convoy ” that occupied downtown Ottawa for more weeks, headed out from Southern California last week for a cross-country trip to the DC region. They plan to arrive this weekend, and Virginia State Police describes the convoy as a “still-fluid situation.” Here’s what you need to know: The “ People’s Convoy ,” a U.S.-based group of activists opposed to vaccine mandates , is on a cross-country trip aiming to arrive in Hagerstown, MD, on Mar. 4 before targeting the DC Beltway area on Mar. 5. Maine to Rescind School Mask Recommendation on March 9 Associated Press reported : Maine’s state government said Wednesday it is rescinding a recommendation for universal masking in schools and childcare facilities. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services and the Maine Department of Education said they are considering mask use optional in those settings starting Mar. 9. The final say will rest at the local level, as local school boards have authority about mask requirements in the state’s school districts. COVID: Quebec to End Most Mask Requirements in April, Stop Vaccine Passport Sooner Global News reported : The Quebec government will ease mask requirements starting in April as well as fully eliminate the province’s COVID-19 vaccine passport system a few days earlier than expected. The province will no longer require masks in the majority of public places — including universities and CEGEPs — starting in mid-April. The government did not give an exact date, but said it will give a notice of 10 days before the measure is lifted. The move comes as masks will no longer be mandatory in elementary and high school classrooms starting next week . Health Minister Christian Dubé said the province’s proof-of-vaccination system will also be entirely phased out on Mar. 12, 2 days earlier than previously announced. All public places will be able to operate at 100% capacity on that date. There will be no capacity limits on tables in restaurants, casinos and bars — and they can return to their regular business hours. COVID in Europe: France to Scrap Face Masks and Vaccine Passes on March 14 Euronews reported : French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced on Thursday that the country would soon remove further COVID-19 restrictions . From Mar. 14, face masks would only be required on public transport while vaccine health passes would not be needed to enter most venues. Proof of vaccination will still be needed to enter French hospitals, health centers and retirement homes, Castex added. ‘Lots of Happy Tears’: Joy as New Zealand Opens Border After Two Years of Isolation The Guardian reported : Tears, hugs, laughter and the shouts of children echoed through the arrivals halls of New Zealand , as the country opened its borders and lifted isolation requirements. For almost two years, New Zealand’s international airports’ arrival terminals have been shuttered ghost towns. Apart from a short-lived travel bubble with Australia, the country’s borders have been closed, with those lucky enough to secure entry into the country whisked to government-managed isolation and quarantine facilities for a costly 2 weeks secluded in a hotel room. Australia Fully Open to Travel as Last State Reopens Border Associated Press reported : Australia was fully open to vaccinated travelers after Western Australia on Thursday became the last state to lift border restrictions. The state lifted restrictions on Thursday, 4 months after Sydney began its staged reopening of quarantine -free travel and more than a week after all vaccinated tourists became eligible for visas. Ukraine Wants to Basically Kick Russia Off the Internet. Terrible Idea. Slate reported : Many of the world’s most popular platforms and services have sought to stymie Russia’s information operations and propaganda amid its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Meta , Google , Twitter , TikTok, and others have de-platformed, demonetized, and de-amplified Russian state media and official channels, making them official participants in the information war that they largely refused to wade into in the months and years leading up to the war on Ukraine. But Ukraine wants to go even further by kicking Russia off the internet. Shutting down some 5 million domains — including those belonging to local news outlets, non-governmental organizations and civic groups — would potentially be kicking much of the country offline. Disconnecting the Russian internet would make it more difficult for people in the country, some of whom vocally and at great risk oppose the war, to express themselves and provide an alternative narrative to Putin’s propaganda machine. ‘We Were Terrified’: Block Co-Founder Explains How the Fintech Giant Avoided ‘Death by Amazon’ CNBC reported : In 2014, Amazon launched a product that sounded strikingly similar to something already on offer from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s payments company Square, which is today known as Block. It was called Amazon Register, and it would let small businesses accept credit card payments using a smartphone or tablet computer, just like Block’s technology. There was one key difference, though: Amazon offered processing fees of as low as 1.75% , compared to the 2.75% rate from Block. “We were still a startup, and Amazon copied our product and undercut our price,” Jim McKelvey, who co-founded Block with Dorsey in 2009, said during a fireside discussion with CNBC at the Mobile World Congress tech show. “When Amazon does this to a start-up, the start-up dies,” he added. “When Amazon did that to Square, we were terrified.” Block wasn’t unique in facing possible “ death by Amazon .”",1,1

The ruling has proved that the government faked COVID-19 death statistics . Following a citizen’s petition, a Lisbon court was forced to provide verified COVID-19 mortality data. According to the ruling (read full judgment below), the number of verified COVID-19 deaths from January 2020 to April 2021 is only 152, not about 17,000 as claimed by government ministries. All the “others” died for various reasons, although their PCR test was positive. The data are from the Sistema de Informação dos Certificados de Óbito (Death Certificate Information System – SICO ), the only such system in Portugal. The reference to 152 death certificated issued ‘under Justice Ministry supervision’ is spurious, as all death certificates are issued under Justice Ministry auspices, being the only institution that issues them. Last year, a Portuguese appeals court has ruled that PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test. The court stated, the test’s reliability depends on the number of cycles used and the viral load present. Citing Jaafar et al. 2020 , the court concludes that: “if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the rule in most laboratories in Europe and the US), the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is 97%.” In Germany, it was revealed according to extensive email exchanges obtained by a group of lawyers in a legal dispute, that the German Interior Ministry hired scientists to develop fake coronavirus model in order to justify strict lockdown .

According to Axios , If America’s current COVID-19 surge continues unabated into the fall and winter, the country will likely face an even more deadly strain of the virus that could evade the current coronavirus vaccines, NIAID director Anthony Fauci told McClatchy Wednesday. Fauci’s comments underscore the importance of acting quickly to vaccinate the tens of millions of Americans who have not been inoculated against the virus. The current surge in coronavirus cases nationwide is being driven by the Delta variant, which is already more contagious than the original strain of the virus. According to The Kansas City Star , The country could be “in trouble” entering the fall unless a large portion of unvaccinated Americans decide to get the shots, with the real possibility a new variant emerges that challenges the effectiveness of existing vaccines, the chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden said in an interview with McClatchy. “What we’re seeing, because of this increase in transmissibility, and because we have about 93 million people in this country who are eligible to get vaccinated who don’t get vaccinated — that you have a significant pool of vulnerable people,” said Fauci, who is the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “And so when you look at the curve of acceleration of 7-day averages of cases per day, it is going up in a very steep fashion,” he said.

In a teleprompter speech, Pedo Joe said that he plans to use his “power as president” to remove every state governor who defies his regime’s imposition of medical fascism against federal, contract and large-scale corporate employees that they all get jabbed for Chinese Germs. “If they’ll not help,” Biden mumbling during his announcement, “if these governors won’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my power as president to get them out of the way.” Were someone to say this same thing about Biden, the Secret Service would likely intervene to try to prevent a possible assassination. When Biden says it against state governors, though, liberals apparently cheer with excitement. “The reaction from state governors made it clear that a major line in the sand has been crossed, and civil war is now officially brewing,” wrote Hal Turner from the “Hal Turner Radio Show.” Hunter’s dad pitched a fit after numerous state governors, including South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, tweeted that they will not be complying with Biden’s vaccination demands. “The American Dream has turned into a nightmare under President [sic] Biden and the radical Democrats,” McMaster wrote. “They have declared war against capitalism, thumbed their noses at the Constitution, and empowered our enemies abroad. Rest assured, we will fight them to the gates of hell to protect the liberty and livelihood of every South Carolinian.” Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas called Biden’s decree an “assault on private businesses,” reiterating the fact that his own executive order “protecting Texans’ right to choose whether they get the COVID vaccine” blocks any and all vaccine mandates coming from the feds. “The Biden Administration’s recent announcement seeking to dictate personal freedom and private business decisions is an insult to our American principles of individual liberty and free enterprise,” added Gov. Michael Parsons of Missouri to the conversation. “This heavy-handed action by the federal government is unwelcome in our state and has potentially dangerous consequences for working families. Vaccination protects us from serious illness, but the decision to get vaccinated is a private health care decision that should remain as such. My administration will always fight back against federal power grabs and government overreach that threatens to limit our freedoms,” he added. China Joe really has crossed a line by to be some kind of medical dictator. The gall of this man thinking that he holds any power to force chemical injections into people’s bodies under duress is off the charts. And yet it all makes sense that a pedophile like himself would seek to medically rape Americans, including underage Americans, with dangerous Big Pharma needles. The good news is that Americans now know where this tyrant truly stands. There are still tens of millions of patriots in this country who have no plans to ever concede to the Pedophile-in-Chief under any circumstances. “We should be celebrating this moment of clarity, for Biden’s audacious actions have just turned half of America into a powerful new vaccine resistance movement,” says Mike Adams, the Health Ranger. “This is, of course, an act of treason and against the United States of America, and it opens the window for the white hats in the U.S. military to and declare his ‘rule’ to be an unconstitutional occupation,” the Health Ranger adds, speculating as to what might happen next in this nightmare saga.

Facts about covid-19 The fully referenced 20 facts about covid-19 have been thoroughly updated. In the section below the summary, there are 16 updated diagrams, followed by all recent SPR articles on covid-19. Read more : Facts about covid-19 or in German: Fakten zu Covid-19 Origin of SARS-CoV-2 The summary of evidence regarding the origin of the novel coronavirus has also been fully updated. Based on current evidence, the Wuhan Institute of Virology remains the most likely source, but a natural origin or a more complex, geostrategic background cannot be excluded. As in previous pandemics, the WHO is primarily engaged in PR activities. Read more : On the origin of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Real-world studies confirm that vaccine effectiveness in people up to about 70 years is high, but the level of effectiveness in older people remains uncertain . Moreover, neutralization achieved by current mRNA vaccines against the ‘Brazilian’ and ‘South African’ variants is already 10 to 100 times lower ; therefore, regular ‘booster shots’ will likely become necessary . Reported post-vaccination deaths in the USA and Europe are approaching 5000 . The real figure may be even higher as there is a substantial reporting backlog . Contrary to media reports, deaths after mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) are higher than after AstraZeneca. Dozens of cases of blindness, deafness and miscarriages have also been reported . US physician J. Patrick Whelan had warned the US FDA already in early December that vaccines based on the coronavirus spike protein may themselves trigger symptoms of severe systemic covid, including blood clots, pulmonary embolism and brain inflammation. According to New York attorney Aaron Siri, governments and employers are not (yet) permitted to require covid vaccinations, as covid vaccines have not yet been fully authorized: they only received an “emergency use authorization” . For the same reason, health insurers view covid vaccines as “experimental” and may decline cost coverage in case of adverse events. Read more : Covid vaccines: Post-vaccination deaths and The “Vaccine Passport” Agenda Early treatment Note : Patients are asked to consult a doctor. The covid-19 early treatment protocol has been updated and now includes budesonide (a corticosteroid asthma spray) as well as PVI-based mouthwashes and nasal sprays, all of which have been found to be effective against coronavirus infection in several small studies. In a recent 15-minute testimony , US professor Dr Peter McCullough, lead author of a landmark paper on covid early treatment, emphasized the importance of ambulatory multi-drug treatment in high risk patients to inhibit viral replication, disease progression, and the development of severe covid complications. The late-treatment strategy adopted in many Western countries may have been one of the most consequential mistakes of the entire pandemic. Indeed, even the very expensive monoclonal antibodies were found to be totally ineffective in hospitalized patients, but highly effective in early treatment. However, some monoclonal antibodies have already lost their effectiveness against some of the new virus variants. Read more : On the Treatment of Covid-19 Long covid According to the latest, most solid studies, about 2% to 10% of people report post-acute symptoms lasting longer than three months. The good news is that myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) is less common than initially assumed. Unfortunately, many long covid studies lack PCR or antibody confirmation, a control group, and a symptom severity score. Read more : On post-acute covid (“long covid”) Masks The fact that masks don’t work against influenza-like pandemics has been known since the “Spanish flu” in 1918/19, and has been confirmed many times since . However, the coronavirus pandemic for the first time has shown that even FFP2/N95 respirator mandates make no difference at all: Covid cases in Bavaria (FFP2/N95 mandate) vs. Germany overall ( DaFeid/ARD/RKI ) Global covid mortality and lethality By the end of March 2021, there were close to 3 million covid deaths in close to 8 billion people. At a global infection attack rate of 10% to 30%, this results in a global covid mortality of about 0.035% and an average global covid lethality (IFR) of 0.1% to 0.35%. By comparison, in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020, tuberculosis and malaria alone each (!) claimed fifty to a hundred times more years of life than Covid-19. In Western countries, corona lethality is higher than the global average, but nursing homes, while representing only about 1% of the population, account for about 50% of deaths . Thus, IFRs in the non-nursing home population typically range between 0.3% and 0.6% .

The recently proposed measures are, in effect, a reversal of steps taken earlier this autumn, when Denmark became one of the first European nations to remove restrictions and demote COVID-19’s threat level. Since then, however, the nation has been rocked by record infection figures unseen since 2020, which the prime minister blamed on the unvaxxed. The health pass will be required at indoor events with over 200 spectators and outdoors events with over 2,000 spectators. Furthermore, the government supported once again upgrading COVID-19 to the status of “critical threat to society”, a step that allows restrictions, such as face mask mandates, assembly limits and lockdowns, to be introduced. This measure has been backed by the ruling Social Democrats’ sidekicks: the Red-Green Alliance, the Socialist People’s Party and the Social Liberal Party. “We cannot let the virus run wild in Denmark”, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said , as quoted by TV2. At the same time, Frederiksen also called for more Danes to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “It can’t be said clearly enough. Those of you who are not yet been vaccinated: do so”, she emphasised. “For all of you who are unvaccinated, life is going to become more difficult. And that’s actually how I think it should be,” she added. The prime minister’s message was crystal clear: it’s the unvaccinated that are largely to blame for the situation Denmark is in right now. “There is a small group that doesn’t play by the rules of the game in a pandemic. You bear a responsibility for the whole of Danish society right now,” Mette Frederiksen said. Denmark currently has a Covid-19 vaccination rate of just over 75 percent. The health pass documents a recent negative COVID-19 test or immunity against the virus due to vaccination or recent recovery from infection. The validity period for earlier infections will thus be reduced from one year to merely six months. Furthermore, the pass will be required from those over the age of 15, a change from the previous minimum age of 16. The proposed measures are, in effect, a reversal of the steps made in September, when Denmark became one of the first European nations to wind down restrictions and demote COVID-19’s threat level. Since then, however, the Scandinavian nation has been swept by a COVID wave unseen since 2020.Monday saw the fifth consecutive day with over 2,000 new cases in Denmark. On Monday alone, wholly 2,294 Danes tested positive for COVID, with a test positivity rate of 2.25 percent.Given the recent development, numerous health professionals and medical professors called for the reintroduction of the health pass, along with the use of face masks and other restrictive measures, as a way of curbing infection “here and now.” Aaron Rodgers blasts “cancel culture” and the “woke mob” after revealing he’s unvaxxed and consulted Joe Rogan about COVID treatments.",1,-1

It is unclear whether boosting with Omicron-specific vaccines would enhance immunity and protection. Here, nonhuman primates that received mRNA-1273 at weeks 0 and 4 were boosted at week 41 with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-Omicron. Neutralizing antibody titers against D614G were 4760 and 270 reciprocal ID50 at week 6 (peak) and week 41 (pre-boost), respectively, and 320 and 110 for Omicron. Two weeks after boost, titers against D614G and Omicron increased to 5360 and 2980, respectively, for mRNA-1273 and 2670 and 1930 for mRNA-Omicron. Following either boost, 70-80% of spike-specific B cells were cross-reactive against both WA1 and Omicron. Significant and equivalent control of virus replication in lower airways was observed following either boost. Therefore, an Omicron boost may not provide greater immunity or protection compared to a boost with the current mRNA-1273 vaccine. www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.03.479037v1 See also Dad confronts school after his daughter has to sit in a cold vestibule for hours without access to food or water because she didn’t wear a mask See also Cramer reverses, likes $ARKK again after 15% surge.

Meanwhile, The Exposé is reporting that public health data in the UK shows that the vast majority of deaths and hospitalizations in the UK are among those vaccinated, and now there are 35 deaths and 213 hospitalizations being reported among those who have received booster shots and are triple-vaccinated. BREAKING – Latest Public Health Data confirms Triple Vaccinated are still being hospitalised and dying due to Covid-19 by The Exposé Excerpts: The latest data available from Public Health Scotland proves that the triple vaccinated are still catching Covid-19, being hospitalised with Covid-19, and dying due to Covid-19, despite claims the booster dose gives the recipient “ultimate” protection. Public Health Scotland publish a weekly Covid-19 Statistical Report which contains data on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths by vaccination status, and the latest report was published Wednesday 22nd December . Table 13 of the latest report shows the number of cases by vaccination status between 20th November and 17th December and proves that the majority of Covid-19 cases are among the vaccinated population, with thousands of cases being confirmed among those who have had their “booster”. The report confirms that between 20 Nov and 17 Dec there were 31,946 cases among the not-vaccinated population, 7,779 cases among the partly vaccinated population, 51,102 cases among the double vaccinated population, and 6,945 cases among the triple / booster vaccinated population. The report confirms that between 20 Nov and 17 Dec there were 381 hospitalisations among the not-vaccinated population, 70 hospitalisations among the partly vaccinated population, 740 hospitalisations among the double vaccinated population, and 213 hospitalisations among the triple / booster vaccinated population. The report confirms that between 13 Nov and 10 Dec there were 63 deaths among the not-vaccinated population, 13 deaths among the partly vaccinated population, 251 deaths among the double vaccinated population, and 35 deaths among the triple / booster vaccinated population. This means the unvaccinated population accounted for just 17% of deaths between 13 Nov and 10 Dec, whilst the vaccinated population accounted for 83%. Read the full article at The Exposé . Here are a few examples of stories of victims who sacrificed themselves to the Vaccine Cult and have now had their lives terminated or ruined. Tiffany Daly: 28-Year-Old Becomes Paralyzed Shortly After Receiving Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine by The COVID World A young woman’s life has potentially changed forever after she received her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Tiffany Daly, 28, suddenly lost feeling in her legs and collapsed on July 22nd. She spent more than a week in hospital undergoing numerous brain scans and MRIs where a neurologist finally diagnosed her with transverse myelitis. Tiffany, who had never heard of the condition before, explained: “ It’s inflammation that is in your spine. Most people have it from their neck to all the way to their toes, which I’m very blessed to have it just from my waist to my toes.” Transverse myelitis causes pain, muscle weakness, paralysis, sensory problems, or bladder and bowel dysfunction. There are many causes, including infections and immune-system disorders like multiple sclerosis. However, Tiffany said that she was completely healthy before the incident and was shocked when the doctor told that her sudden injury was likely caused by her first injection of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine , which she received just weeks before her legs went numb. “I was just confused because I was paralyzed and I was scared, you know? And that’s like the last thing I kind of wanted to hear: I was paralyzed by the Moderna vaccine.” The 28-year-old, who does not have health insurance, hadn’t been working at her job long enough to qualify for full-time benefits. After she became ill, she moved into her mom’s Oceanside home in a retirement community, where her mom is now her full-time caretaker . Tiffany and her mother, Cathy, reported her case to the CDC and submitted it to the VAERS database .

In all cases, Tiffany said, they received a generic reply and were assigned a case number . “You know, I live on very little Social Security.

Albert Owusu Sarpong: 20-Year-Old Student Dies 2 Days After Receiving COVID-19 Vaccine by The COVID World A student of the University of Ghana has died just two days after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Albert Owusu Sarpong, 20, developed multiple health issues after receiving the jab on December 13th. Joshua Wonder, a roommate of Sarpong, revealed the saddening news in a video that went viral overnight. According to his friend, Sarpong started feeling unwell and experienced nausea, dizziness, and vomiting hours after having the jab . “I honestly don’t know what’s going on right now. I don’t know what’s happening. I just received news that one of my roommates from University has died this morning. And he took the vaccine, like, two days ago. He literally took the vaccine two days ago. He was completely healthy before he took the vaccine. So how is it that he just died this morning? I honestly don’t get it. So could it be that the vaccine killed him?” The death of Sarpong is creating thousands of reactions on social media under the hashtag #JusticeForAlbert , with many Ghanaians demanding a full-scale investigation into the sudden death of the 20-year-old Political Science student .

Tanya Smith: Mother-Of-Three Died From Blood Clots After Receiving AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine by The COVID World A mother-of-three died from multiple blood clots less than two weeks after having received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, an inquest has found . Tanya Smith, 43, was rushed to hospital after waking with stomach cramps days after her jab. Tanya received her jab on March 21st this year at the Plymouth Argyle vaccination clinic. She was admitted shortly after to Plymouth’s Derriford Hospital where it was found that she had developed multiple blood clots . The mother-of-three suffered a heart attack and then deteriorated before dying in hospital on April 3rd . Her partner, Kenneth Edwards, said after her death: “She was just amazing, selfless. She was a childminder, a really good childminder for 19 years. She leaves three children behind, two grown-up children and a 12-year-old little girl with disabilities. She loved her family, she was really family orientated and she’d go above and beyond. We’re all pretty lost without her. I’ve never experienced anything like this.” At Smith’s inquest yesterday, senior coroner Ian Arrow said the blood clots were a “ very rare complication ” of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Arrow said: “It appears to me some days after [her vaccination] she then developed a number of thromboses throughout her system. In other words, a number of blood clots. I’m satisfied those blood clots have led to her death. On the balance of probability, this is a very rare complication of this particular kind of treatment.” Her husband Kenneth believes she would not have died if she hadn’t had the AstraZeneca vaccine . “She obviously had a reaction from the jab. She’d never suffered from blood clots. She was healthy before she had that jab.” Read the full story at The COVID World . Maxwell Harrison: Ballroom Dancer Develops Pericarditis After Receiving Pfizer Vaccine, Unable To Dance For At Least A Year by The COVID World A British ballroom dancer has developed pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart muscle) shortly after receiving his second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Maxwell Harrison, 21, suffered chest pains and breathing difficulties five days after the shot and was hospitalized. Harrison was told by top cardiologists in the country that his heart condition was a result of the Pfizer vaccination. His ballroom dancing career is now on hold for at least the next 8-12 months assuming he fully recovers from his vaccine injury. Harrison joined British channel GBNews tonight where he said. “I’ve got stress tests coming up. I’ve got an MRI tomorrow to determine how bad the pericarditis is. Being a dancer, I can’t dance anymore, completely off any physical exercise. And they reckon that’s going to be between eight to twelve months to properly and deal with this issue.” Just a few months ago, Harrison was competing at the World Dance Council Amateur Dance Championships with his dance partner Katie. The couple made it to the finals of the competition and ended up in the 5th spot. The achievement made them one of the best amateur ballroom dancers in the world . The couple called it “ undoubtedly the single greatest achievement in our lives ”. It is unsure if they will ever be able to compete again in high-level ballroom dancing.

On the one hand there has been a flood of revelations revealing the unprecedented scale of the deaths and injuries being caused by the improperly tested COVID injections. Much of this information is accompanied by analysis revealing the tactics being deployed to misrepresent and hide the massive harm being done. Public understanding of the lethal harm our society is absorbing from the COVID jabs is growing just as authorities are joining together to impose mandatory vaccines on many classes of workers and students. This imposition of mandatory vaccines is being opposed by a growing coalition of Frontline Workers for Freedom. This group has organized large demonstrations throughout Alberta including at Calgary, Edmonton, and Lethbridge. At Lethbridge City Hall about 400 people gathered at City Hall on Wednesday September 15 to oppose mandatory vaccines. In Alberta like elsewhere throughout North America, the public movement against forcing employees to be stabbed by unwanted COVID jabs is being led by police, EMS workers, and some nurses. By and large the leadership of trade unions is not backing up the position of their members who are resisting taking the dangerous COVID injections as a condition for retaining their jobs. Nor is the Student Union at the University of Lethbridge or the professors’ faculty association at the U of L protecting their membership from the dangers associated with the vaccines. They are not standing up for the principles of freedom or choice or bodily autonomy. My recently-published article on the failure of trade unions to align themselves with the upsurge of popular resistance to the coercive imposition of mandatory vaccination is available at Global Research.ca. See this . Mike Whitney is the bearer of a lot of bad news in his well-documented article entitled. “ The Conspiracy Theorists Were Right, It IS a Poison Death Shot .” Whitney describes that the COVID jabs were allowed to receive tentative emergency use authorization in spite of the fact that top authorities in the regulatory agencies knew the jabs would cause death, injuries and infertilities. As Whitney sees it, its not human error that is causing the harm but rather the damage is being done because of the malevolence of those pushing the vaccines on the world population. Whitney concludes by writing, The vaccine isn’t supposed to work, it’s supposed to make things worse. And it has! It’s increased the susceptibility of millions of people to severe illness and death. That’s what it’s done. It’s a stealth weapon in an entirely new kind of war; a war aimed at restructuring the global order and establishing absolute social control. Those are the real objectives. It has nothing to do pandemics or viral contagion. It’s about power and politics. That’s all. Dr. Joseph Mercola, a leading member of the of the group that US President Joe Biden labelled the “Disinformation Dozen,” surveys legal cases involving legal challenges to mandatory vaccinations. Biden is attempting to force the owners and managers of all businesses with over 100 employees to require mandatory vaccinations as a condition of employment. One of the legal strategies being used to oppose vaccine mandates in court involves the scientifically-well founded argument that natural immunity to COVID-19 is much more strong, resilient and adaptable that the weak and circumscribed immunity from the COVID shots. In fact vaccines undermine the natural immunity of those who have been infected with COVID-19. See this . Biden has made coercively-imposed vaccines a centerpiece of his presidential administration in a sharply worded speech where he basically characterized so-called “unvaccinated” people as enemies of the state. Justin Trudeau is employing a similar strategy in his campaign for re-election in Canada. How can you run an election campaign when all the main parties basically agree on almost everything? Trudeau seems to think he can appoint the unvaccinated as the foes he promises to defeat if elected. The “unvaccinated” are being demonized and dehumanized. We are being blamed for many things, including the completely false claims that it is us who are filling the hospitals. This process of dehumanization is all too familiar to an aroused group of holocaust survivors. They see another vicious crime taking shape. They write, If 80 years ago it was the Jews who were demonized as spreaders of infectious diseases, today it is the unvaccinated who are being accused of spreading the virus. Physical integrity, freedom to travel, freedom to work, all coexistence has been taken away from people in order to force vaccination upon them. Children are being enticed to get vaccinated against their parents’ judgement. See this . Whitney’s article calls attention to the interventions of top medical researchers in Europe who identify their group as Doctors for Covid Ethics. The group includes Prof. Sucharit Bhakdi, Prof. Martin Haditsche and Dr. Michael Yeadon , all top authorities in their fields. In February of 2021, 12 health care professionals including those named above warned the European Medicines Authority that it should not give the COVID jabs emergency use authorization. The Doctors for Covid Ethics blew the whistle, arguing that the vaccines were too dangerous and that they were likely to cause a wide array of serious blood ailments as well as infertility. I wrote about their intervention in a Global Research essay earlier in September. It is entitled “ Herd Stupidity .” On September 13 the same scientists wrote back to the European Medicines Authority noting the failure of the EMA to take their professional whistle blowing seriously. They explain the murderous consequences of the disastrous decision to “ rush to vaccines first and conduct research later .” Infamy is cast on many officials who showed contempt for the scientific method by their decision to rush ahead with mass injections of vaccines before proper research could take place. The malfeasance extends to the enforcers of mandatory vaccines including President Mike Mahon of the University of Lethbridge. Rather than deal with the increasingly compelling case that the vaccines are doing much more harm than good, Dr. Mahon and the University of Lethbridge Board of Governors chose to indiscriminately and coercively push mandatory vaccinations on the entire university community including students, faculty members, and staff. Of course many university presidents corporate presidents, government officials, and media moguls are guilty of the same malfeasance. But the cooptation of universities removes a major obstacle to the plans of those behind the manufactured COVID crisis. It seems that a primary condition for participation in the activities of higher education these days is to demonstrate a willingness to buckle to administrative dictate rather than stand on the ground critical thinking and sound independent research. The intervention of the Doctors for Covid Ethics comes in the form of a notice of liability making explicit the guilt of those officials who chose to ignore their medical intervention back in February. It is worthwhile to share a lengthy section of the notice. They begin by explaining This request [for a response from the European Medicines Authority back in February]was scorned and the vaccination program has been rolled out on a global scale, with catastrophic consequences that we trust are known to you. Our original fears have been confirmed and further pathways leading to injury and death by the experimental agents have been uncovered through new scientific discoveries in 2021. The rush to vaccinate first and research later has left you in a position whereby COVID-19 vaccination policy is now entirely divorced from the relevant evidencebase. This request was scorned and the vaccination program has been rolled out on a global scale, with catastrophic consequences that we trust are known to you. Our original fears have been confirmed and further pathways leading to injury and death by the experimental agents have been uncovered through new scientific discoveries in 2021. The rush to vaccinate first and research later has left you in a position whereby COVID-19 vaccination policy is now entirely divorced from the relevant evidence base….. As you consider your next steps in mandating a vaccine that is contra-indicated by science, we draw your attention to recently published Freedom of Information requests, which reveal gross negligence in the COVID vaccine authorisation process, including misleading the Commission on Human Medicines as to whether any independent verification of vaccine trial data had occurred. Hapless and defenceless children are now becoming victims of the blasphemic and negligently regulated vaccination agenda. We charge you for actively or tacitly paving the way to the second holocaust of mankind. The same charge has been independently submitted by survivors of the first holocaust and their families. You are hereby placed on notice that you stand to be held personally and individually responsible for causing foreseeable and preventable harm and death from COVID-19 vaccines, and for supporting crimes against humanity, defined as acts that are purposely committed as part of a widespread or systematic policy, directed against civilians, committed in furtherance of state policy. The gravity of your deeds is now laid out before the world. For the sake of yourselves and your families, rise and respond. Or go down in history books in indelible shame and disgrace. Signed, Doctors for Covid Ethics Cc: Rechtsanwaltskanzlei Dr. Reiner Fuellmich The US Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, carries similar regulatory responsibility for these COVID vaccines as the does the European Medicines Authority in the EU. In Canada, Health Canada is the responsible agency that gave the vaccines’ emergency use authorization. The FDA is in serious disarray especially after it gave “approval” to a new Pfizer COVID vaccine to be known as Comirnaty. This disarray developed because the FDA failed to include its own panel of scientific experts a say in the approval process. Some on the panel resigned because of the decision to leave then out of the process. This failure can be seen as yet another violation of the precautionary principle. The supposedly “approved” product, however, is currently unavailable and probably will not be available until Pfizer gets a guarantee that it will not be sued for any deaths or injuries caused by the Comirnaty vaccine. The indemnification of vaccine companies speaks of the corrupt nature inherent in the public-private partnerships integral to the workings of the pharmaceutical industry. Like many industries, Big Pharma has captured its regulators. All too often government agencies overseeing the activities of companies like Pfizer or Moderna have officials who are patent holders with proprietary interests in some of the very products they assess and oversee. The notorious litany of lies and conflict-of-interest swirling around Dr. Anthony Fauci is emblematic of an industry gone horribly wrong. On Sept. 17 the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee refused to approve the release of the booster shot that Joe Biden had declared would become available on September 20. This refusal of the usual suspects to comply with the agenda of quick and compliant authorization signals that something is changing. Even insiders are starting to try to distance themselves from the dark cloud of corruption that hangs over the whole area of government regulation in the era of the manufactured COVID Crisis. Dr. Hall is editor in chief of the American Herald Tribune. He is currently emeritus Professor of Globalization Studies at University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada. He has been a teacher in the Canadian university system since 1982. Dr. Hall, has recently finished a big two-volume publishing project at McGill-Queen’s University Press entitled “The Bowl with One Spoon”. You can actually participate in the global efforts to cripple the Deep State organized criminal cabal's ability for genocide, while enjoying healthcare freedom at the same time, by boycotting Big Pharma for good.

By early April, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada restricted use of the chimpanzee adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine that was co-developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca 2 to people over age 55 or 60 due to the occurrence of pulmonary embolisms, brain hemorrhages and deaths in people between 25 and 60 years old, the majority of them women. 3 4 5 After announcing that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was safe for distribution in mid-March, the EMA recommended updating the warning label for the experimental vaccine to better inform the public of the potential risks. 6 7 8 Close to 20 countries, mostly in Europe, temporarily discontinued the use of the vaccine entirely or in batches after approximately 37 reports of cases of blood clots occurring after vaccination. 9 10 11 Woman in Denmark Dies From Blood Clot After AstraZeneca Covid-19 Shot Authorities in Denmark suspended all COVID-19 vaccinations with the Oxford/AstraZeneca brand after a 60-year old woman died from a blood clot after vaccination. 12 Danish Health Minster, Magnus Heunicke, said the vaccination suspension was a temporary cautionary measure. 13 And, Danish authorities clarified that “it has not been determined, at the time being, that there is a link between the vaccine and the blood clots.” 14 Director of the National Board of Health in Denmark, Søren Brosttrøm said: It is important to emphasize that we have not opted out of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but that we are putting it on hold. There is good evidence that the vaccine is both safe and effective. But both we and the Danish Medicines Agency have to react to reports of possible serious side effects, both from Denmark and other European countries. It shows that the monitoring system works. 15 Other countries including Norway, Sweden Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Iceland, Luxenberg, Germany and Ireland also suspended the use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in batches or altogether. 16 17 18 Latvia, Lithuania, Luxenbourg and Bulgaria resumed use of the vaccine following the EMA’s conclusion it is safe, 19 20 21 while Norway, Iceland and Denmark are continuing to review the data before proceeding with vaccination. 22 Danish officials have said that once the vaccine is back in use, people will have the choice to refuse the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in favor of other COVID-19 vaccines. 23 Some Countries Restrict Oxford/Astra Zeneca Covid Vaccine to People Over Age 60 Finland’s Institute of Health and Welfare conducted their own investigation into two reports of blood clots after receiving the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and have continued giving it to people over 65 years of age. Sweden has also returned to giving the vaccine, but only for persons aged 65 and older. 24 Johan Carlsen, MD, head of the Swedish Public Health Agency said: The vaccine is very useful for the elderly as many become seriously ill with COVID-19 every day… At the same time, we haven’t seen a risk of these rare and serious side effects in the elderly. That is the reason why we are canceling the break for people over the age of 65. 25 Germany initially resumed use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine following the EMA conclusion it is safe, but then restricted its use to those over the age of 60 due to additional reports of blood clots occurring after vaccination. Germany’s independent vaccine committee, STICKO, said that their decision to restrict use of the vaccine to those over 65 was “based on the currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects. This side effect occurred 4 to 16 days after vaccination, predominantly in people (under) 60 years of age.” 26 The Netherlands, Iceland, Indonesia, Bulgaria and Thailand also chose to halt the use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine due to safety concerns following reports of blood clots post vaccination. 27 28 29 30 The Netherlands, Iceland, Bulgaria and Thailand have resumed vaccination with the Astra Zeneca brand and Indonesia is using the vaccine with a warning for those with blood clotting disorders to not get the vaccine. 31 32 33 34 Spain stopped vaccinating those between 55-65 years of age but has since continued vaccination. 35 36 France announced that it would stop the use of the vaccine for 24 hours while Italy also announced it has curtailed the use of the vaccine as a precaution. 37 After the preliminary findings by the EMA, both Italy and France began using the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine again but with caveats. France is limiting its use to those aged 55 years or older and Italy is allowing citizens who refuse the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to take another brand at a later time. 38 Suspension of AstraZeneca Vaccine is the Latest in a Series of Controversies The suspension and restrictions on using the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID vaccine in Europe and Asia is the latest in series of controversies for the company. It began with a dispute over the Oxford/AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial data, followed by a shortfall of vaccine supplies, and then doubts were raised about the effectiveness of the vaccine in the over 65 population due to the lack of data. Finally, the vaccine was suspended in many countries over concerns about the risk of developing a blood clot. 39 40 Although most countries have resumed its use, some doubts remain about the vaccine. According to Sunaina Sinha Haldea, managing partner at Cebile Capital, AstraZeneca “seems to have a real PR problem on its hands in the U.S. and in Europe… public relations problem risks undermining confidence in the vaccine outside of the U.K.” 41 Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany allegedly refused to get the vaccine because she does not, “belong to the group recommended for AstraZeneca.” The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, admitted that the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was “quasi-ineffective” for people over the age of 65, one of the most vulnerable populations. In Germany, people are not showing up for their appointments to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and only 107,000 doses have been given of the 737,000 doses received. 42 AstraZeneca/Oxford Vaccine Supply Unused in Europe Much of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine supply has gone unused in Europe. 43 44 According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, as of Mar. 11, France, Germany, Italy and Poland have used less than half of the doses of the vaccine that they have in stock. 45 Europe falls far behind the U.S., Israel, the U.A.E., the U.K. and Chile in vaccinations per 100 people. 46 European healthcare workers, including healthcare unions and a group of 3,000 doctors in Italy, have refused the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine due to efficacy and safety concerns. Some are insisting on receiving the Moderna/NIAID or Pfizer/BioNTech COVIC-19 vaccines, which they believe are more effective at reducing disease symptoms. Jerome Marty, MD, the president of a French Doctor’s union said, “Medical staff need the most effective vaccine. We need to keep the AstraZeneca vaccine for healthy and young people.” 47 When France began using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on Feb. 6, authorities reported seeing more side effects than they did with the other COVID-19 vaccines. The French medicines safety agency issued guidance to stagger the shots when given to front line workers to prevent disruption of operation due to the strong flu like side effects reported by 149 out of the 10,000 shots given. 48 An AstraZeneca spokesperson defended its product, saying… Regulators have clear and stringent efficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine, and that includes COVID-19 vaccine by AstraZeneca. … The safety of the vaccine has been extensively studied in Phase III clinical trials and peer-reviewed data confirms the vaccine has been generally well tolerated. 49 The World Health Organization (WHO) has maintained that there is no indication that the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has caused the severe side effects including blood clots and death. 50 AstraZeneca denies any connection to the risk of blood clots, noting… Around 17 million people in the E.U. and U.K. have now received our vaccine, and the number of cases of blood clots reported in this group is lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population. 51 Emer Cooke, the head of the EMA stated that the safety committee “has come to a clear scientific conclusion. This is a safe and effective vaccine.” Despite assurances, the EMA has indicated it will continue to investigate the risk of blood clots with the Oxford/Astra Zeneca COVID-19 vaccine and has updated the vaccine’s warning label. 52 53 Researchers Find that the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Can Trigger Autoimmune Reaction and Blood Clots Independent medical researchers in Germany and Norway discovered that an autoimmune reaction causing blood to clot in the brain could be triggered by the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Although the research has not yet been peer reviewed, the lead researcher in Norway, Pål André Holme, who identified the antibody that caused the blood clots due to the vaccine said, “Nothing but the vaccine can explain why these individuals had this immune response.” 54 In Germany, researchers agreed with these findings and said that a blood test could diagnose CVST in people who have vaccine adverse reactions such as headaches, dizziness or impaired vision four days after they received the shot so that they can be treated with blood thinning medication and immunoglobulin. Robert Klamroth, MD, Deputy Chairman of the Society for Thrombosis and Hemostasis in Germany concluded: We believe the most likely hypothesis is that this particular vaccine is causing a rare autoimmune reaction that triggers antibodies, which then interact with the platelets, but we don’t know why this is happening. 55 Norway is holding off on restarting vaccination with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine while Germany has resumed using it despite these findings. In response, AstraZeneca relied on its earlier statement that CVST did not occur more frequently in those vaccinated than it would have in the general population. The EMA refuted that there was a causal link between the vaccine and CVST, but acknowledged the link is possible and further analysis warranted.

And it is devastating.","by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Our most-read article last week, by far, was the article on Senator Ron Johnson’s Roundtable discussion held in Washington D.C. where doctors, scientists, and COVID-19 vaccine injured victims met to discuss COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The entire recording of this event is over 3.5 hours long, and so I have been watching it and breaking up the speakers into individual videos to make it easier to watch this truly historical event that happened at our nation’s capital last week. 10 of these powerful presentations were published with that article last week, and you can watch them here: Doctors and COVID-19 Vaccine Injured Testify in Washington D.C. to Crimes Against Humanity – CDC, FDA, NIH, Fauci are No Shows One of the most powerful presentations was given by Dr. Linda Wastila, who is a PhD professor and heads the Department of Pharmaceutical Health Services Research at the University of Maryland. ( Source .) In her initial presentation, which we published last week , Dr. Wastila stated: We are citizens who have done our civic duty, but when we suffer serious adverse effects, we’re left high and dry by the FDA, the CDC, the NIH and medical professionals. We are scientists alarmed by the toxic environment in academia and scientific publishing. We are military leaders concerned about vaccine safety in the armed services. We are clinicians who want to treat patients harmed by the vaccines but whose practices are limited by our employers and professional boards. And we are lawyers and patient advocates seeking help for our injured clients and their families. We are the people you haven’t heard from. And we have nothing, absolutely nothing to personally gain from being here. Indeed, we have everything to lose, including our jobs, our titles, our livelihoods. But we don’t intend to go away until we see some real change. Dr. Wastila later in the meeting gave another presentation about VAERS ( Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) and the “science of vaccine safety.” Dr. Wastila is very critical of the CDC for using sound bytes with the public and stating that COVID-19 vaccines are “safe.” The statement that everyone by now has heard come out of the mouth of CDC Director Rochelle Walensky many times, and which is fraudulently printed on the CDC website , is: Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines under the most intense safety monitoring in U.S. history . Dr. Wastila states: The impression is the system is so finely tuned that even the rarest needle in the haystack will be found. I am afraid that is just not the case. Now remember, the reason Senator Johnson invited Dr. Wastila is because drugs and drug safety is her area of expertise. She states that the process to determine if there are problems that need to be addressed based on reported side effects in VAERS is a very slow process, and she uses myocarditis as an example. It took four months into Israel’s national vaccine campaign to recognize this side effect. That’s besides the fact that myocarditis generally strikes within days of dosing, particularly the second dose. So officials were experiencing this side effect for months before officials recognized the vaccine as the cause. This delay in detecting, researching, and acknowledging side effects is normal. And it is devastating. The patients at this meeting today know that devastation first hand. But it’s also devastating because unless you first recognize harms soon after they occur, you can’t use that knowledge in the next person about to get the vaccine. I am stunned when I hear people dismiss myocarditis as an acceptable side effect, especially for young people. Because myocarditis is life-threatening, and a life-disabling condition. As I reported last week, the CDC admits that myocarditis is caused by COVID-19 vaccines, but they dismiss it as “rare.” This is what is currently published on the CDC website : Myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. As of October 27, 2021, VAERS has received 1,784 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people ages 30 and younger who received COVID-19 vaccine. Most cases have been reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), particularly in male adolescents and young adults. Through follow-up, including medical record reviews, CDC and FDA have confirmed 1,005 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis. CDC and its partners are investigating these reports to assess whether there is a relationship to COVID-19 vaccination. Why are we continuing to inject children with these shots? Under what possible logic or ethics is 1,784 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people under the age of 30 acceptable? There are far more reports of myocarditis or pericarditis following COVID-19 shots than following ALL vaccines for the past 30+ years recorded in VAERS. And we know this is only a fraction of the actual cases because VAERS is under-reported, and many of these cases have already led to deaths. The CDC and FDA have never conducted a study to determine what this under-reported factor is, but independent scientists have, and we have previously published the analysis conducted by Dr. Jessica Rose , who has determined that a conservative under-reported factor would be X41. That would put the truer picture of young people suffering from myocarditis closer to 74,928 cases, and now they have just begun to inject 5 to 11 year olds. Watch Dr. Linda Wastila’s presentation.

This was as entirely predictable as it is completely meaningless. The ""variants"" are just tools to stretch the story out and keep people on their toes. If you want to know exactly how the Omicron variant is going to affect the narrative, well The Guardian has done a handy ""here's all the bullshit we're gonna sell you over the next couple of weeks"" guide: The Omicron variant is more transmissable, but they don't know if it's more dangerous yet (keeping their options open). It originated in Africa, possible mutating in an ""untreated AIDS patient"" (sick people are breeding grounds for dangerous ""mutations""). ""it has more than double the mutations of Delta...scientists anticipate that the virus will be more likely to infect - or reinfect - people who have immunity to earlier variants. (undermining natural immunity, selling more boosters, keeping the scarefest going). ""Scientists are concerned"" that current vaccines may not be as effective against the new strain, they may need to be ""tweaked"" (get your boosters, and the new booster we haven't invented yet) ""Scientists expect that recently approved antiviral drugs, such as Merck's pill, will work as effectively against the new variant"" (more on this later) It's already spreading around the world, and travel bans may be needed to prevent the need for another lockdown We're already seeing preparations for more ""public health measures"" , with the press breathlessly quoting ""concerned"" public health officials. We're being told that a new lockdown won't be necessary...as long as we remember to get boosted and wear masks and blah blah blah. Generally speaking, it's all fairly boilerplate scary nonsense. Although it is quite funny that the Biden administration has already put a bunch of African nations on a travel ban list, when Biden called Trump a racist for doing the same thing in 2020. AFRICA It's interesting that the new variant has allegedly come from Africa, perhaps ""mutating in the body of an AIDS patient"" , since Africa has been the biggest hole in the Covid narrative for well over a year. Africa is by far the poorest continent, it is densely populated, malnourishment and extreme poverty are endemic across many African nations, and it is home to more AIDS patients than the entire rest of the world combined. And yet, no Covid crisis. This is a weak point in the story, and always has been. Last Summer, the UK's virus modeller-in-chief Neil Ferguson attempted to explain it by arguing that African nations have, on average, younger populations than the rest of the world, and Covid is only a threat to the elderly. But five minutes of common sense debunks that idea. The reason Africa has a younger population, on average, is that - on average - they are much sicker. There are diseases endemic to large parts of Africa that are all but wiped out in most of the Western world. Cholera, typhus, yellow fever, tuberculosis, malaria. Access to clean water, and healthcare are also much more limited. And while it has been nailed into the public mind that being elderly is the biggest risk factor for Covid, that is inaccurate. In fact, the biggest risk factor for dying ""of Covid"" is, and always has been, already dying of something else. The truth is that any REAL dangerous respiratory virus would have cut a bloody swath across the entire continent. Instead, as recently as last week, we were getting articles about how Africa ""escaped Covid"", and the continent's low covid deaths with only 6% of people vaccinated is ""mystifying"" and ""baffling"" scientists . Politically, African nations have shown themselves far less likely to buy into the ""pandemic"" narrative than their European, Asian or American counterparts. At least two ""Covid denying"" African presidents - Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi and John Magufuli of Tanzania - have died suddenly in the last year, and seen their successors immediately reverse their covid policies. So maybe the Omicron Variant is a way of trying to fold Africa into the covid narrative that the other continents have already fully embraced. That will become clear as the story develops. Of course, it's also true that being ""African"" is media shorthand for being scary, relying on the deeply-seated xenophobia of Western audiences. See: ""Africanized killer bees"" . But, either way, Africa is the long game. There's a more obvious, and more cynical, short term agenda here. THE MAGIC PILLS Let's go back to one of the Guardian's ""Omicron"" bullet points, above: Scientists are concerned by the number of mutations and the fact some of them have already been linked to an ability to evade existing [vaccine-created] immune protection. Scientists expect that recently approved antiviral drugs, such as Merck's pill, will work as effectively against the new variant because these drugs do not The ""new variant"" is already being described as potentially resistant to the vaccines, but NOT the new anti-viral medications. Pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer are both working on ""Covid pills"", which as recently as three days ago , were being hyped up in the press: US may have a 'game changer' new Covid pill soon, but its success will hinge on rapid testing In the US, an emergency use authorisation can only be issued if there is no effective medication or treatment already available , so the vaccines not being proof against Omicron would be vital to rushing the pills onto the US market, at least. If Omicron is found to be ""resistant to the vaccines"", but NOT the pills, that will give governments an excuse to rush through approving the pills on an EUA, just as they did with the vaccines. So, you bet your ass that testing is gonna be ""rapid"". Super rapid. Blink-and-you'll-miss-it rapid. Rapid to the point you're not even sure it definitely happened. And now they have an excuse. Really, it's all just more of the same. A scare before the new year. An excuse to make people believe their Christmas could be in peril. An exercise in flexing their control muscles a bit, milking even more money out of the double-jabbed and boosted crowd, now newly terrified of the Omicron variant, and a nice holiday bump to Pfizer's ever-inflating stock price. At this point either you can see the pattern, or you can't. You're free of the fear machinery, or you're not. There is one potential silver lining here: It feels rushed and frantic. Discovered on Tuesday, named on Friday, travel bans on Saturday. It is hurried, and maybe that's a reaction to feeling like the ""pandemic"" is losing its grip on the public mind. Hopefully, as the narrative becomes more and more absurd, more and more people will wake up to reality. It has been pointed out that ""Omicron"" is an anagram of ""moronic"" . One wonders if that's deliberate and they're making fun of us.",1,167

Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page,"Key Points Question: What are the findings on cardiac imaging in children with myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination? Findings: In this case series of 15 children who were hospitalized with myocarditis after receipt of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine for 1 to 5 days, boys were most often affected after the second vaccine dose, 3 patients had ventricular systolic dysfunction, and 12 patients had late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. There was no mortality, and all but 1 patient had normal echocardiogram results on follow-up 1 to 13 days after discharge. Meaning: COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis may have a benign short-term course in children; however, the long-term risks remain unknown. Abstract Importance: The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine was authorized on May 10, 2021, for emergency use in children aged 12 years and older. Initial reports showed that the vaccine was well tolerated without serious adverse events; however, cases of myocarditis have been reported since approval. Objective: To review results of comprehensive cardiac imaging in children with myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccine. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study was a case series of children younger than 19 years hospitalized with myocarditis within 30 days of BNT162b2 messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine. The setting was a single-center pediatric referral facility, and admissions occurred between May 1 and July 15, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: All patients underwent cardiac evaluation including an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Fifteen patients (14 male patients [93%]; median age, 15 years [range, 12-18 years]) were hospitalized for management of myocarditis after receiving the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine. Symptoms started 1 to 6 days after receipt of the vaccine and included chest pain in 15 patients (100%), fever in 10 patients (67%), myalgia in 8 patients (53%), and headache in 6 patients (40%). Troponin levels were elevated in all patients at admission (median, 0.25 ng/mL [range, 0.08-3.15 ng/mL]) and peaked 0.1 to 2.3 days after admission. By echocardiographic examination, decreased left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was present in 3 patients (20%), and abnormal global longitudinal or circumferential strain was present in 5 patients (33%). No patient had a pericardial effusion. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings were consistent with myocarditis in 13 patients (87%) including late gadolinium enhancement in 12 patients (80%), regional hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging in 2 patients (13%), elevated extracellular volume fraction in 3 patients (20%), and elevated LV global native T1 in 2 patients (20%). No patient required intensive care unit admission, and median hospital length of stay was 2 days (range 1-5). At follow-up 1 to 13 days after hospital discharge, 11 patients (73%) had resolution of symptoms. One patient (7%) had persistent borderline low LV systolic function on echocardiogram (EF 54%). Troponin levels remained mildly elevated in 3 patients (20%). One patient (7%) had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on ambulatory monitor. Conclusions and Relevance: In this small case series study, myocarditis was diagnosed in children after COVID-19 vaccination, most commonly in boys after the second dose. In this case series, in short-term follow-up, patients were mildly affected. The long-term risks associated with postvaccination myocarditis remain unknown. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to inform recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in this population. Introduction SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in China and evolved rapidly to a global pandemic. Vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are the current standard approach for curbing the pandemic. In the US, the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) vaccines were granted emergency use authorization for adults. On May 10, 2021, the emergency use authorization for the BNT162b2 vaccine was extended to children aged 12 years and older. 1 Myocarditis has been reported as a rare complication of vaccination against other viruses. 2 It was not reported in the initial messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine trials, although the ability to detect rare events was limited by sample size. Since the emergency use authorization, myocarditis in adolescents and young adults after COVID-19 vaccine has been reported. 3 -5 In this series, we detail the occurrence of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination in an adolescent population, including comprehensive cardiac imaging evaluation and follow-up.

This was based on 300 respondents .,"by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons Of the 700 physicians responding to an internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), nearly 60 percent said they were not “fully vaccinated” against COVID. This contrasts with the claim by the American Medical Association that 96 percent of practicing physicians are fully vaccinated. This was based on 300 respondents . Neither survey represents a random sample of all American physicians, but the AAPS survey shows that physician support for the mass injection campaign is far from unanimous. “It is wrong to call a person who declines a shot an ‘anti-vaxxer,’” states AAPS executive director Jane Orient, M.D. “Virtually no physicians are ‘anti-antibiotics’ or ‘anti-surgery,’ whereas all are opposed to treatments that they think are unnecessary, more likely to harm than to benefit an individual patient, or inadequately tested.” The AAPS survey also showed that 54 percent of physician respondents were aware of patients suffering a “significant adverse reaction.” Of the unvaccinated physicians, 80 percent said “I believe risk of shots exceeds risk of disease ,” and 30% said “I already had COVID.” Other reasons for declining the shot included unknown long-term effects, use of aborted fetal tissue, “it’s experimental,” availability of effective early treatment, and reports of deaths and blood clots. Of 560 practicing physicians, 56 percent said they offered early treatment for COVID. Nonphysicians were also invited to participate in the survey. Of some 5,300 total participants, 2,548 volunteered comments about associated adverse effects of which they were aware. These included death, amputation, paralysis, stillbirth, menstrual irregularities, blindness, seizures, and heart issues. “Causality is not proven. However, many of these episodes might have resulted in a huge product liability or malpractice award if they had occurred after a new drug,” stated Dr. Orient. “Purveyors of these COVID products are protected against lawsuits.” The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons has represented physicians in all specialties since 1943. Its motto is omnia pro aegroto , everything for the patient. Read the full article at the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons . Comment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com .

It’s a lifestyle. It’s a conviction – a conviction in solidarity with masses of other people. Venceremos is more than “we shall overcome”. Venceremos is enduring. Venceremos is a movement. Venceremosis persevering against all odds – and Venceremos, finally is dynamics. It’s a concept that adapts to circumstances and moves on and on and on – until and way beyond the movement has achieved its objective. The philosophy of Venceremosis to sustain our efforts to hold onto sovereign control of our lives. Remember, freedom doesn’t come for free. Freedom is a constant movement of protecting our freedom. We may call it the continuous pursuit of Happiness through the philosophy of Venceremos – in action. What is currently being played out by the truckers of Canada – Canada’s Freedom Convoy – is the first such action of Venceremos – of we won’t let go – a peaceful act in solidarity against the Covid atrocities of the Trudeau Government. Such a moement has never been seen, worldwide, in recent human history. Tens of thousands of trucks from all corners of Canada and some from across the border in the US, moving in solidarity towards Ottawa to besiege Prime Minister Trudeau – to either resign or lift immediately all Covid restrictions. As Professor Chossudovsky pointed out , Canada needs the political quarantine of Justin Trudeau . Most of the trucks arrived in Ottawa on Saturday 29 January. They literally beleaguered the Nation’s Capital. Tens of thousands of trucks, tens of thousands of people on foot. Trudeau tried to brush them away, by a ludicrous TV appearance, saying: They are a small minority not representative for Canada . Trudeau’s popularity dropped to 35% , (Angus Reid, December 2021) below US President Biden’s approval rating of 41.8% on 29 January 2022. It was then reported that Trudeau had left 24 Sussex Drive to an unknown destination a “secret location” according to CBC. See video below. For how long can he hold out? According to reports, he will be holding a Press Conference on January 31st. At the time of writing, it was announced that he was Covid-19 positiv , despite having received the required three doses vaccines. The vaccination of Trudeau raised a stir. A registered nurse after examining the videos cast doubts on whether he had been vaccinated. What we are witnessing is a solidarity movement with all the characteristics of “ Venceremos ”. Below is 30 January Video. Across Canada, in towns, and cities, people are in the streets and support the truckers in full solidarity. See video below. The impact on the rest of the world is colossal. In a first phase, the Canada Freedom Convoy is spreading its concept of Venceremos and solidarity to the United States. Although a start date has not been fixed yet, according to American journalist Cassandra Fairbanks, American truckers will form a similar protest convoy from California to Washington DC , with the same purpose, to have all Covid restrictions, Covid passes, masks, forced vaccination and more lifted indefinitely. See this . If this movement takes hold, we can but wish it will also embrace Europe, the European Union (EU) and its puppet members. Should that happen, it would lend Europe a new face of respect. It would be a movement not only to break Brussels (EU HQ) stranglehold on its member countries, but it would return much needed, and much sought-after sovereignty by the vast majority of the people – not the governments – much of which are implants by the WEF and the WEF’s masters. In addition to freeing the peoples from the Covid tyranny, it may also be a first step of de-globalizing the world. Globalization has gradually robbed most countries in Europe of their sovereignty over the last 50 years or so, ever since the foundation of the Club of Rome (CoR) in 1968. Just to understand that the idea and concepts behind todays European Union was not primarily European but American, as the chief founder of the CoR was David Rockefeller ; and the CoR was founded as an NGO in Rome but registered in Switzerland. The report issued in 1972 by the Club of Rome, Limits to Growth , focuses on the exponential economic and population growth with a finite supply of resources, and basically predicts the collapse of civilization by 2030. This became the basis for the 1992 first UN Climate Conference, United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also called Earth Summit, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (June 3–14, 1992). The Earth Summit was the precursor to the infamous UN Agenda 2030. Further visible developments are the different, so-called Conferences of the Parties (CoP) that pretend to hammer into peoples’ consciousness the lies of man-made climate change, the Green Agenda – a new wave of neoliberal capitalism; the hypocritical pretension of exiting from the use of hydrocarbons for the world’s energy use – and so on. Less visibly, but on the same vein of thought, is the 2010 Rockefeller Report, giving the script for the lockstep, lockdowns and fear campaigns to control people by an imaginary virus. This report was followed by many sub-reports, WHO statements, WHO conferences, and finally, culminating in Event 201 (18 October 2019, in NYC), a new SARS virus simulation sponsored by the Gates Foundation, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the World Economic Forum that led the world into the SARS-CoV-2, alias Covid-19 scam, the largest crime of human history. Back to the Freedom Convoys, the relentless Venceremos moves in solidarity, that aim at regaining human rights, human dignity, human sovereignty, and civil liberties, will most likely continue in the US and may actually spread to Europe, as people realize the power behind this peaceful and effective movement. The possibly dire consequences must however be known. They are economic, financial and may affect people’s immediate lives, as they may result in massive unemployment, increased poverty and supply chain disruption. In other words, empty shelves in supermarkets. This may lead to rationing of food and other consumables and famine – and possibly even death in extremis. Deliveries from Asia to the US and Canada, and possibly also to Europe, may be stranded – without further distribution at least for a while. The same may apply for internal US, Canadian – trans-border US-Canada — and internal European deliveries. This will undoubtedly create shortages of food and other consumables. In addition, energy supplies from Russia to Europe may be interrupted, thereby exacerbate hardship for Europeans. President Putin warned about a gas cut-off, as a counter-action to Europe’s unfounded “sanctions”, especially if the West would cut Russia off from the western money transfer system SWIFT. “ Venceremos ” means not giving up , despite these inconveniences. Such contrarieties were amply predicted in the context of the Canadian Freedom Convoy – people stood up and supported truckers unconditionally. We may expect similar reactions in the US and hopefully also in Europe. This may lead to and accelerate the process towards an alternative society or societies. A totally deglobalized population, de-digitized money – back to cash – and away from all digitization. We do not need a dollar/euro-based economy. All to the contrary, we need an economy that stands on its own feet and is backing local currencies. An economy that fully answers to deglobalization – local production, for local markets, with local (non-digital) money and a sovereign local or regional central bank, not connected to the western monetary system . Trade would take place possibly with virtual currencies among like-minded societies, based on comparative advantages to create “win-win” situations. With the onset of neoliberal economics, the concept of comparative advantage, where all parties are winning, the true meaning of trade, has disappeared from economists’ minds. This process of creating a new society, or new societies, is not necessarily fast. It depends on how many nations and societies within nations are willing to venture into a new life stream, chosen by the people, as opposed to a One World Order society, created by the WEF’s Great Reset. This process is part of the Venceremos philosophy. It will gradually teach and accustom people to a new paradigm – a society away from imposed fear and digital surveillance and enslavement. The Freedom Convoys in Canada, the US and Europe – the Venceremos philosophy, active expressions of people’s actions against tyranny — may be accompanied by sister movements of solidarity to enhance and accelerate the attaining of the objectives of Venceremos, by such legal crusades as are already under way by Dr. Reiner Fuellmich , German Corona Investigative Committee . They may bring to justice the chief perpetrators for this genocidal fraud that has been playing out for the past two years, in a Nuremberg 2.0 type trial, either through the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, or another new international legal venue. See this and this . There is no doubt, the tide is turning . It may not be turning as fast as we wish, as many of the highly corrupted mainstream media still defend the ongoing Covid and vaxx narrative. Most mainstream media in the west do not, or only in a largely distorted way report about the Freedom Convoys, and about the increasing amount of people, who say enough is enough, Venceremos – breaking out from the tyranny. Going back to the beginning: Venceremos is more than “winning” or “we shall overcome”. It is an enduring concept, a philosophy that creates a mindset in people of never again letting go and letting fear and enslavement take away our freedom and sovereign lives. * Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

We discovered that scientists are fallible human beings, and some would let personal interests and political views cloud their judgment. Is science itself one of the victims of the COVID-19 pandemic? I asked Dr. Scott Atlas at the 13th annual Freedom Conference hosted by the Steamboat Institute, a Colorado-based nonprofit organization. Formerly a professor and chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center, Atlas is now a senior fellow in health policy at the Hoover Institution. Atlas has been under constant attacks by the left and the corporate media since he served as a special adviser to former President Trump and a member of the White House coronavirus task force from August to November 2020. The New York Times and the Washington Post ran hit pieces on Atlas, questioning his qualifications despite his distinguished career and scholarship. Google-owned YouTube also removed a 50-minute video of Atlas’s interview with the Hoover Institute. Twitter took down his that questioned the effectiveness of masks. Atlas has refused to be silenced. He has a lot to say about how the scientific field and Americans’ trust in it have been tremendously harmed during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Science has been not just a victim,” he told me, “but actively participated in the self-destruction of its credibility.” To prove his point, Atlas referred to the now infamous letter published in Lancet, which denounced the lab-leak theory as a “conspiracy” that created “fear, rumors, and prejudice.” Facebook “fact-checkers” used the letter to censor discussion of the lab-leak theory for more than a year. It then surfaced in The Daily Mail that Peter Daszak, president of Eco Health Alliance, orchestrated a group of scientists to write the letter without disclosing the EHA’s close financial ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). Now many scientists accept that the WIV lab-leak theory is just as probable as the natural origin theory. Atlas also faulted leading scientific publications such as Nature and Lancet for playing “important roles in enabling, encouraging, and enforcing the false narrative.” In June, journalist Ian Birrell cited one source who estimated the publisher of Nature had sponsorship agreements worth millions of dollars from Chinese institutions. “Science is not supposed to be about intimidating, countering interpretation of data, or abusing, or censoring data,” Atlas said. “Science is not supposed to have a view. Science is only about data and the scientific process. There is never supposed to be ‘an accepted view’ of science.” Politicians and pundits also lost people’s trust by advocating regulations that were not based in fact. “The phrase ‘follow the science’ should never be uttered again by people who do not know actual data. They must stop,” Atlas said. “They have no credibility whatsoever when they get up and say, ‘follow the science.’ It’s clear many of them don’t know the science, don’t understand the science, and they are not using the science to make the recommendations.” How can science and scientists recover from this trust deficit? “It depends on only one thing — the visibility of the scientific process, which by definition is about the visibility of the data,” Atlas said. “There should be no censorship of views and interpretation of different data. Do not intimidate or issue harsh condemnations of people just because you disagree with them. Let the truth prevail by the data.” He has received hundreds of emails from other scientists who have encouraged him to remain outspoken while afraid to speak up themselves. “The saving of science really depend[s] on scientists to come forward and to be unafraid to say that the objectivity of science and [the] scientific process itself has been contaminated and impeded,” he continued. “When more scientists come forward, there hopefully will be a reversal of that [trust deficit]. There is no such thing as science without the evidence being visible and debates being current. Science doesn’t exist in any other way.” How can we do a better job of fighting back the next time our ruling class tries to send us into crisis mode? We have to recognize what the data revealed about this current pandemic, Atlas said, citing several recent studies (including one by Eran Bendavid and other scientists of Stanford University) showing that lockdowns didn’t work to keep COVID-19 from spreading while imposing their own severe additional costs. Lockdowns destroyed people, Atlas said, by “shutting down medical care, stopping people from seeking emergency medical care, increasing drug abuse, increasing death by suicide, more psychological damage, particularly among the younger generation. Hundreds and thousands of child abuse cases went unreported. Teenagers’ self-harm cases have tripled.” Atlas also noted the increase of other deaths like tuberculosis, caused by the world’s focus on COVID-19. The World Health Organization warned in 2020 of up to an additional 400,000 deaths from tuberculosis because of the diversion of resources to COVID-19. “Mortality data showing that anywhere from a third or half of the deaths during the pandemic were not due to COVID-19,” Atlas said. “They were extra deaths due to the lockdowns.” Besides causing health issues, the lockdowns have enormous economic costs, especially for poor people and developing countries. The Bangladesh economy’s shutdown during the pandemic, Atlas noted, was forecast to wipe out about $3 billion and close to 900,000 jobs off the nation’s economy with a devastating effect on the nation’s poor. “We can never use the lockdown strategy again,” Atlas emphasized. Instead, we should offer targeted protections for high-risk people but no lockdowns of low-risk people. Other scientists, such as the authors of The Great Barrington Declaration, have advocated for the same approach. Atlas offers additional advice on how to prepare for the next pandemic based on lessons learned from COVID-19 in his upcoming new book, “ A Plague Upon Our House: My Fight at the Trump White House to Stop COVID from Destroying America, ” which is available for preorder now. Ultimately, Atlas said, the most important lesson to learn from the COVID-19 pandemic is that individuals must take responsibility for their own health-related decisions. We should never surrender our autonomy and capability to assess our risk tolerance to bureaucrats or the so-called expert class. Read more at: TheFederalist.com",1,167

Are they investigating them to see if the pharmaceutical companies are acting criminally?,"Vitamins, Pixabay Donald Trump signed the ‘COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act’ last December that makes it illegal for anyone to promote non-pharmaceutical products as treatments for COVID-19. The law threatens doctors with $10,000 fines for each violation if they tell you the science about how vitamins and minerals can help with COVID. The Department of Justice is pursuing a case against a Missouri chiropractor for “deceptive marketing” of COVID treatments after he publicly stated that a vitamin-D and zinc supplement could prevent or effectively treat COVID—claims that are well-supported in the scientific literature. -GEG When people in Europe started dying from fatal blood clots shortly after receiving experimental COVID injections last month (March, 2021), some countries began criminal investigations over the deaths, including Italy which launched a manslaughter investigation after several people died following the injections. Here in the U.S., as of this week, the CDC is stating that they have received 3,486 reports of people dying following the experimental COVID injections. So what is the U.S. Government’s response to all these deaths being reported? Are they investigating them to see if the pharmaceutical companies are acting criminally? No, last week the Department of Justice announced that they were going to start enforcing a new bill signed into law back in December by then President Donald Trump, which makes it illegal for anyone to promote non-pharmaceutical products as treatments for COVID-19. The law is called the “COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act.” The name is mislabeled, however, as it does not protect consumers from dangerous products that can harm or kill them, such as the experimental COVID “vaccines,” but it protects the pharmaceutical industry instead, by eliminating free speech for non-pharmaceutical remedies for COVID-19. This law really should be named the “COVID-19 Pharmaceutical Protection Act.” And the first victim to suffer under this new law is a St. Louis chiropractor who was recommending Vitamin D and zinc supplements to his clients, and is now charged as a criminal.

According to Twitter user @kbarve, the scientific community may want to look at humidity as it relates to the surge. Keep reading for a breakdown: Continued via Threadreader App The air arriving to the lungs should contain 35 g/kg of water. In summer, the air contained about 10 g/kg and the epithelium had to add 25 g/kg . From October 9 on, 20% more water was needed from the epithelium overnight 20% increase in any burden is tough even for a short period. Replace a 75 g racquet by a 90 g one and ask a good badminton player to play his standard play. He will need a rest very soon or be broken. Epithelium would also need a rest but it can't. Mucus covering the upper respiratory epithelium is responsible for moisturizing the inhaled air , acting as a barrier between the environment and the epithelial cells. The mucosal microbiome also turns the inhaled viral particles harmless. When absolute humidity drops, the water supply to the epithelium should be increased but do we know how fast such change can take place? And is there a limit to the water supply? How many have no idea of the importance of mucosal hydration of the air at all? In the winter 2020/21, Estonia had two major drops of absolute humidity. From average 8 g/kg to average 5 g/kg on Oct 14-20, triggering the rapid increase in infection. Average humidity then gradually decreased to average 4 g/kg by December, population acclimatized... ... until the humidity dropped to below 2.5 g/kg for three consecutive weeks in February. Vulnerability increased among younger population then, another wave of infection was triggered, and the hospitalizations were taken to the capacity limit of 700. The waves of COVID-19 have broken when the absolute humidity has increased and not dropped back below customization level for a while . It happened so in the spring 2020, in the spring 2021, and also in the autumn 2021 in all Baltic countries simultaneously. People in moderate climate have been suffering from infectious diseases from every autumn till spring and the epidemiological pattern is very similar each year. Diseases start with the beginning of the school and peaks in the second half of each winter. Since the emergence of centralized heating, the problem of indoor humidity has only become worse. Modern HVAC systems are aimed at supplying fresh air at low energy cost but these systems are still failing to address indoor humidity and maintain its healthy level. It has been long known that the incidence of viral diseases is higher in very dry and very wet air, i.e. in nordic winter with and in tropical heat, both causing body to dehydrate. (Fig from Tamerius, Shaman et al. 2013) The pending problem of inadequate indoor climate from autumn till spring must be solved by engineering means considering human in its full complexity. No human has by any reason deserved to spend hours at below 30% relative humidity. The school environment detected in December 2020 during the mandatory increased ventilation is absolutely criminal. It is worth considering the possibility that the recommended intense ventilation might not improve the epidemiological situation at all but even make it worse. Mankind has been chasing the virus for two years now and not yet recognized that humans and their internal ecosystems have evolved to manage all inhaled viruses and their consequences. The frontline to protect each individual from viral infection and disease are mucosal microbes who are just unable to perform when the individual has chosen to, be unwillingly, dry up their natural environment and expose the mucosal cells to all possible pathogens. It makes no sense to assume that any intervention other than water could compensate for the chronical dehydration from dry indoor environment in cool season, inadequate water intake (eg in nursery homes), or excessive sweating in hot summer. Meanwhile when engineers keep themselves busy solving the problem of dry indoor air, hanging wet towels can provide massive, immediate relief to your mucosal microbiome at almost no cost.",1,-1

However, the new strain has caused some previously-unreported symptoms, including nausea and vomiting. While the Omicron variant of the coronavirus can cause the classic symptoms of Covid-19 ​​– fever, persistent headaches, and a loss of smell or taste, it can also cause the symptoms of a traditional cold. The five most common symptoms logged in Britain’s ZOE Covid tracking app are indistinguishable from those of the common cold : a runny nose, headaches, fatigue, sneezing, and a sore throat. However, some people infected with Omicron have suffered nausea and vomiting, Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London and one of the founders of ZOE, told the Daily Express on Sunday. Spector added that these symptoms were reported by fully vaccinated people, as well as some who had received booster shots. Earlier, the ZOE study revealed a loss of appetite as a symptom of Omicron infection. The similarities between Omicron and cold symptoms come amid reports that the new strain of the virus is more transmissible but significantly less virulent than its predecessors. Nevertheless, the spread of Omicron has prompted a tightening of restrictions in the UK, and the declaration of a “major incident” by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Despite the fact that vaccines appear ineffective against Omicron, the British government has stepped up its booster shot campaign, with NHS staff administering jabs on Christmas Day and the government aiming to offer everyone in Britain a booster shot by the end of the year. Aside from the instances of nausea and vomiting, Spector said that Omicron’s cold-like symptoms shouldn’t make anyone complacent. “Hopefully people now recognise the cold-like symptoms which appear to be the predominant feature of Omicron,” he wrote on ZOE’s website last week, adding that people should “change their behaviour,” and begin “wearing face masks again, cancelling parties and working from home more” to slow the spread.

When he addressed them, he stated “I am probably the smartest person you know, and I spent 8 months analyzing this thing.” He blamed “anti-vaxxers” for causing suffering and death to others, and wrote: If you’re an anti mask anti-vaxxer, I DO NOT CARE what happens to you. And I don’t care why you believed it. Other people’s lies take root in the lies we tell ourselves. Mr. Rowe was a truck driver, mechanic, carpenter, and general contractor who lived in Florida. He ran for election to the Florida House of Representatives to represent District 23. Mr. Rowe also ran for election to the U.S. House to represent Florida’s 3rd Congressional District.
